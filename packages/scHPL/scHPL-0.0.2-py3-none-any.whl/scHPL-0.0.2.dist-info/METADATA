# Hierarchical progressive learning of cell identities in single-cell data

We present a hierarchical progressive learning method which automatically finds relationships between cell populations across multiple datasets and uses this to construct a hierarchical classification tree. For each node in the tree either a linear SVM or one-class SVM, which enables the detection of unknown populations, is trained. The trained classification tree can be used to predict the labels of a new unlabeled dataset. 

### Installation

scHPL requires Python 3.6 or 3.7. The easiest way to install scHPL is through the following command::

    pip install scHPL

### General usage

The ```tutorial.ipynb``` notebook explains the basics of scHPL. The [vignette folder](vignettes) contains notebooks to reproduce the experiments.  

### Datasets

All datasets used are publicly available data and can be downloaded from Zenodo. The simulated data and aligned datasets used during the interdataset experiments can be downloaded from the [scHPL Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4557712). The filtered PBMC-FACS and AMB2018 dataset can be downloaded from the [scRNA-seq benchmark Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3357167)
