DataLad development is being performed as part of a US-German collaboration in
computational neuroscience (CRCNS) project "DataGit: converging catalogues,
warehouses, and deployment logistics into a federated 'data distribution'"
(Halchenko_/Hanke_), co-funded by the US National Science Foundation (`NSF 1912266`_) and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF 01GQ1905).
Additional support is provided by the German federal state of
Saxony-Anhalt and the European Regional Development
Fund (ERDF), Project: `Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences`_, Imaging Platform.

DataLad is built atop the git-annex_ software that is being developed and
maintained by `Joey Hess`_.

The extension was created during the OHBM Hackathon 2020 and wouldn't have been possible without a `dedicated team of volunteers <https://github.com/datalad/datalad-osf#contributors->`_.
