          <p align="justify">
            Sandpiper performs an organised and automatic extraction of elevation profiles from as many DSM and orthophotos as you like. It is thought to be used when a considerable number of DSMs and orthohpotos from many different locations and coordinate reference systems need to be processed.
            Then, computes volumetric and behavioural analysis of beachfaces, speeding up an otherwise long and difficult to handle (big rasters) job.
            It has some specialised functions to deal with the common limitations found in beach environments:
          <ol>
            <li>Swash zone: the water motion as waves wash in and out of the swash zone prevent Structure from Motion algorithm to find matches, thus, model elevation.</li>
            <li>Vegetation: both dune vegetation and beach wracks (macroalgae, woody debris) should be removed or filetered as can compromise sediment volumetric computation.</li>
            <li>File size: a few km long beach surveyed with a Phantom 4-Advanced at 100m altitude create roughly 10 Gb (uncompressed) of data, which can be cumbersome for some GIS to handle.</li>
          </ol>
        
          From user-defined cross-shore transects, you can clean profiles from unwanted non-sand points, detect significant hotspots/coldspots (cluster) of beach change, compute       volumetric dynamics at the site and transect levels, plot alongshore change and model beachface behaviour using the Beachface Cluster Dynamics indices.
        
          Plus, some outils functions that can come at hand, like automatic transect creation from a vector line, grid creation along a line and subsequent tiles extraction and others.
        
          Follow the Jupyter Notebook tutorials (IN PREPARATION) to understand how it works!

        <!-- Background -->
        ### Background
        This code has been developed to ease the analysis of big data coming from more than 300 Unnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) surveys, performed by Citizen Scientist in Victoria, Australia. This is the [Eureka Award Winning](https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/media-releases/articles/eureka-prize-win-for-world-first-citizen-science-program) World-first [beach monitoring program powered by volunteers](https://www.marinemapping.org/vcmp-citizen-science "info on the Citizen Science project"), who autonomously fly UAVs on 15 sensitive sites (erosional hotspots) across the Victorian coast, every 6 weeks for 3 years, since 2018. This project is part of a broader marine mapping program called The [Victorian Coastal Monitoring Program (VCMP)](https://www.marineandcoasts.vic.gov.au/coastal-programs/victorian-coastal-monitoring-program "VCMP website"), funded by the [Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning](https://www.delwp.vic.gov.au/ "DELWP website"), co-funded by [Deakin University](https://www.deakin.edu.au/ "Deakin Uni website") and [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/ "UniMelb website").
        
        Each survey creates Digital Surface Models and orthophotos of considerable size (5-10 Gb uncompressed), which can be troublesome for some GIS to render, let alone perform rster-based computations.
        
        <!-- modules -->
        ### Modules
        
        * **.outils**: main storage of useful functions.
        * **.profile**: extract elevation and colour information across profiles from a folder of rasters.
        * **.labels**: use KMean and Silhouette analysis to help clean the extracted elevation data from unwanted non-sand points.
        * **.hotspot**: use Local Moran's I to disscard spatial outliers and obtain significant hot/cold spots of beach change at site and transect levels.
        * **.dynamics**: compute Beachface CLuster Dynamics indices at the site and transect levels.
        * **.volumetrics**: compute volumetric timeseries of sand-only points and create plots.
        * **.space** (under development): simple satellite and UAV instantaneous waterlines tidal-correction and shoreline shifts/error metrics.
        
        
        
        <!-- GETTING STARTED -->
        ## Getting Started
        
        To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        * [Install Conda] in your local machine. We need it to create the **"sandpiper_env"** virtual environment.
        * then, if you do not have it already, install **Visual Studio C++ build tools** in your local machine, which is needed to install the [richdem](https://pypi.org/project/richdem/ "richdem pypi page") package. You can download it [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ "standalone VS c++ build tools").
        * now, in the Anaconda Prompt terminal, create the environment **sandpiper_env** and install the required packages by typing:
          ```sh
          conda create --name sandpiper_env geopandas tqdm pysal=2.1 scikit-learn scikit-image rasterio scipy seaborn matplotlib
          ```
        * now, let's PIP install richdem in the newly created environment **sandpiper_env** (ps.: remember to `conda activate sandpiper_env` ). Type:
         ```sh
         pip install richdem
         ```
         For the exact packages versions, consult the [sandpiper_env.yml file](https://github.com/npucino/sandpiper/blob/master/sandpiper_env.yml).
        
        ### Installation (temporary - will be a package in PyPI)
        
        1. Locate the **site-package** folder inside the sandpiper_env folder created by Conda and clone the repo inside that.
        
          >**Example**: C:\conda3\envs\sandpiper_env\Lib\site-packages
          >
           Type in conda prompt:
           ```sh
           cd C:\conda3\envs\sandpiper_env\Lib\site-packages
           git clone https://github.com/npucino/sandpiper.git
           ```
        2. Once you open a Jupyter Notebook with the sandpiper_env, import it to test it works.
           ```sh
           import sandpiper
           ```
