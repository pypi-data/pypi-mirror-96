Renews
======

When you start a new season, you have a number of members who renew their subscription. 
If you have already registered that person in your software, you can search by the plug and add a license for the new season.
If you have a lot of turnover this treatment is very long!

You can then use the list to renew Members
In this list, you find all members of the previous season that have not yet been renewed.
To add their reassessment, two solutions:
 - From a unitary manner:
	open each file and add the new license.
 - Globally:
	select multiple files in the list and click Renew. Each person will then be renewed on the same terms as the previous season (same contribution, same license number, same team, same activity).
