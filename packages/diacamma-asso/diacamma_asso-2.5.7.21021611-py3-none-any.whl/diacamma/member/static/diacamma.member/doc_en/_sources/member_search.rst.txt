You can then do a search according to various criteria concerning the identity or membership.
You can also search for one of the following membership criteria 'documents requested' or a custom field.

**Note:** if you do a search with the criteria linked to a contribution (team, documents, license number, ...) be sure to specify the search season.
The result is a list of members corresponding to the criteria provided.

You can merge multiple sheets of the same person in one.
For this you must specify the main person, the tool will remove other records after moving all their references on the main record.
If you want to remove a member, it should not have had any activity.

Since the search tool, you can also search for duplicate membership records. This allows you to view a list of members with similar name and first name.
From here you can also merge or delete the redundant files.
