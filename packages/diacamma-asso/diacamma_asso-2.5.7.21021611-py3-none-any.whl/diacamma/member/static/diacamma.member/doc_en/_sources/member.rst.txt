This sheet contains:
 - The identity of the participant: name, address, telephone, date and place of birth ...
 - The list of his memberships.
 - Other dependent tabs installed extensions, including the list of qualifications / training / degrees or the accounts.

If you have defined a list of registration documents in the season you can, individually, check the available documents. An impression of the status of all members on the subject is available from the list of members.
Since a participant is an individual, you find the same cards from the contact list. It also is possible for you to promote a simple physical contact member; you will have just completed her profile.
Finally, since the profile of a member, it is possible to give it a right of access, or alias, to *Diacamma*. (See Users)

Depending on your connection rights, it will be possible to change the identity of a member, add a past membership or graduation.
