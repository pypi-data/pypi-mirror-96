    'long_description': '# asconnect\n\nasconnect is a Python wrapper around the [Apple App Store Connect REST APIs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi).\n\nThis wrapper does not cover every API, but does cover the basics, including:\n\n* Uploading a build\n* Creating a new TestFlight version\n* Setting TestFlight review information\n* Creating a new app store version\n* Setting the app review information\n* Submitting for app review\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\nThe package is available on PyPI, so you can run `pip install asconnect` to get the latest version.\n\n### Creating a client\n\nTo begin, you need to [generate a key](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api), then get it\'s ID, the contents of the key itself, and the issuer ID.\n\nOnce you have those, you can create a new client by running:\n\n```python\nclient = asconnect.Client(key_id="...", key_contents="...", issuer_id="...")\n```\n\n### Getting your App\n\nMost operations require an app identifier. This is not the same as the bundle ID you choose, but is an ID generated by Apple. The easiest way to get this is to run this code:\n\n```python\napp = client.app.get_from_bundle_id("com.example.my_bundle_id")\n```\n\n### Uploading a Build\n\nUploading a build isn\'t technically part of the App Store Connect APIs, but a wrapper around altool is included to make things as easy as possible. Let\'s upload a build for your app:\n\n```python\nclient.build.upload(\n  ipa_path="/path/to/the/app.ipa",\n  platform=asconnect.Platform.ios,\n)\n```\n\nAnd if you want to wait for your build to finish processing:\n\n```python\nbuild = client.build.wait_for_build_to_process("com.example.my_bundle_id", build_number)\n```\n\n`build_number` is the build number you gave your build when you created it. It\'s used by the app store to identify the build.\n\n### App Store Submission\n\nLet\'s take that build, create a new app store version and submit it,\n\n```python\n# Create a new version\nversion = client.app.create_new_version(version="1.2.3", app_id=app.identifier)\n\n# Set the build for that version\nclient.version.set_build(version_id=version.identifier, build_id=build.identifier)\n\n# Submit for review\nclient.version.submit_for_review(version_id=version.identifier)\n```\n\nIt\'s that easy. Most of the time at least. If you don\'t have previous version to inherit information from you\'ll need to do things like set screenshots, reviewer info, etc. All of which is possible through this library.\n\n\n# Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
