Description: # **Supvisors**
        [![PyPI version][pypi-image]][pypi-url] [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci-url] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url] [![Documentation Status][docs-image]][docs-url]
        
        
        **Supvisors** is a Control System for Distributed Applications, based on
        multiple instances of Supervisor.
        
        The main features are:
           * a new web-based dashboard that replaces the default dashboard of Supervisor,
           * an extended XML-RPC API to control applications and multiple Supervisor instances,
           * the definition of a rules file to handle:
              * the starting sequence of the applications,
              * the stopping sequence of the applications,
              * the starting strategy of the processes,
              * the strategy to apply when a process crashes.

        ## Supervisor Enhancements
        
        **Supvisors** proposes a fix to the following Supervisor issues:
           * [#122 - supervisord Starts All Processes at the Same Time](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/122)
           * [#456 - Add the ability to set different "restart policies" on process workers](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/456)
           * [#520 - allow a program to wait for another to stop before being stopped?](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/520)
           * [#1023 - Pass arguments to program when starting a job?](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/1023)
           * [#1150 - Why do event listeners not report the process exit status when stopped/crashed?](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/1150)
        
        ## Supported Platforms
        
        **Supvisors** has been tested and is known to run on Linux (CentOS 8.3).
        It will likely work fine on most UNIX systems.
        
        **Supvisors** will not run at all under any version of Windows.
        
        **Supvisors** >= 0.2 works with Python 3.6 or later.
        
        **Supvisors** 0.1 (available on PyPi) works with Python 2.7 (and former versions of Supervisor, i.e. 3.3.0)
        but is not maintained anymore.
