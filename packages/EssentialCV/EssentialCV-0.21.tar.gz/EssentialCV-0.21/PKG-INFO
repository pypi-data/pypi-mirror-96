Description: # EssentialCV
        --------------
        
        * This is a simplified module for the great OpenCV Library.
        * Most of the essential functions in the library are condensed to a minimal and easy to understand code.
        	
        * This project is usefull for simple and small works only. 
        * Some Functions use values that cannot be passed while calling. These values are from OpenCV library
        	that do not have a huge impact on simple usage.
        		example: `cv.threshold(frame, th1, th2, cv.THRESH_BINARY)`
        		Here everything except cv.THRESH_BINARY can be passed while calling the function.
        
        ## Installation:
        * `pip install EssentialCV`
        
        ### In this module:
        * Image will be sometimes reffered as Frame or img.
        * Threshold will be called thresh
        * Blank is a blank image used for masking.
        * My personal best methods for different functions will be mentioned.
        	
        ### Requirements:
        * OpenCV
        * Matplotlib
        * Numpy (included with OpenCV)
