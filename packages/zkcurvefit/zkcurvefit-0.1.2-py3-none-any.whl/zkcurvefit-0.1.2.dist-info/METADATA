zkcurvefit module has curvefit method which takes 3 arguments file-to-read, file-to-write, timestep-max , density_coeff (dilution factor), plot = "on" or "off" reads the file and curvefits every column with the initial column which should be timestep column [1:tmax].

"It's written for decaying datasets."

It write 3 files

    1 = all curvefit data points
    2 = once in 50 curvefit data points
    3 = koff values where koff = 1/tauOff

For curvefit to work best you need to have big datasets with first column is timestep with 1 increments starting with 1 since timestep 0 disrupts the curveffitting algorithm used here.
