       Parameters
       ----------
       go_from: int, str or list of int / str
         The ID(s) of the demographic(s) to move from. This is the old
         parameter name used to maintain backwards compatibility.
         Prefer to use from_demo if you can
       go_to: int, str or list of int / str
         The ID(s) of the demographic(s) to move to. This is the old
         parameter name used to maintain backwards compatibility.
         Prefer to use to_demo if you can
       from_demographic: int, str or list of int / str
         The ID(s) of the demographic(s) to move from. This can be either
         a single demographic (identified by an integer ID or string),
         a list of demographics, or, if None, then all demographics.
       to_demographic: int, str or list of int / str
         The ID(s) of the demographic to move to. This can be either
         a single demographic (identified by an integer ID or string),
         a list of demographics, or, if None, then all demographics.
         If this is not set, then it is equal to "from_demo"
       from_stage: int, str or list of int / str
         The ID(s) of the disease stage(s) to move from. This can be either
         a single stage (identified by an integer ID or string),
         a list of stages, or, if None, then all stages.
       to_stage: int, str or list of int / str
         The ID(s) of the disease stage(s) to move to. This can be either
         a single stage (identified by an integer ID or string),
         a list of stages, or, if None, then all stages. If this
         is not set, then it is equal to "from_stage"
       from_ward: int, str, WardID, or list of int / str / WardID
         The ID(s) of the ward(s) or ward-links(s) to move from. This can
         be either a single ward or ward-link (identified by an integer ID
         or string or WardID), a list of ward(s)/ward link(s), or, if None,
         then all wards and ward links.
       to_ward: int, str, WardID, or list of int / str / WardID
         The ID(s) of the ward(s) or ward-links(s) to move to. This can
         be either a single ward or ward-link (identified by an integer ID
         or string or WardID), a list of ward(s)/ward link(s), or, if None,
         then all wards and ward links. If this is not set then it is equal
         to "from_ward"
       fraction: float
         The fraction of individuals in each ward to move, e.g. 0.75 would move
         75% of the individuals in a ward / ward-link. By default 100%
         are moved.
       number: int
         The maximum number of individuals in each ward / ward-link to move.
         The fraction is taken from min(number, number_in_ward). By
         default all individuals in a ward / ward-link are sampled.
       **kwargs:
         This calls go_ward, so any options that are acceptible to go_ward
         (with the exception of 'generator') can be passed here too
