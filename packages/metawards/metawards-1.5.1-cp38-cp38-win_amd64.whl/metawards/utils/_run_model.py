       Parameters
       ----------
       network: Network or Networks
            The network(s) on which to run the model
       infections: Infections
            The space used to record the infections
       rngs: list
            The list of random number generators to use, one per thread
       population: Population
            The initial population at the start of the model outbreak.
            This is also used to set the date and day of the start of
            the model outbreak
       seed: int
            The random number seed used for this model run. If this is
            None then a very random random number seed will be used
       output_dir: OutputFiles
            The directory to write all of the output into
       nsteps: int
            The maximum number of steps to run in the outbreak. If None
            then run until the outbreak has finished
       profiler: Profiler
            The profiler to use to profile - a new one is created if
            one isn't passed
       nthreads: int
            Number of threads over which to parallelise this model run
       iterator: MetaFunction or string
            Function that will be used to dynamically get the functions
            that will be used at each iteration to advance the
            model. Any additional files or parameters needed by these
            functions should be included in the `network.params` object.
       extractor: MetaFunction or string
            Function that will be used to dynamically get the functions
            that will be used at each iteration to extract data from
            the model run
       mixer: MetaFunction or string
            Function that will mix data from multiple demographics
            so that this is shared during a model run
       mover: MetaFunction or string
            Function that can move the population between different
            demographics

       Returns
       -------
       trajectory: Populations
            The trajectory of the population for every day of the model run
