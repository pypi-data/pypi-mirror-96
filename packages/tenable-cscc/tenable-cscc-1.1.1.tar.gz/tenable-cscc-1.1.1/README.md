# Tenable.io -> Google Cloud Security Command Center

This tool is designed to consume Tenable.io vulnerability data,
transform that data into the Google Security Command Center format, and then
upload the resulting data into Google Security Command Center.

The tool can be run as either as a one-shot ingest or as a continuous service.

### Requirements for use

* API Keys for a service account in Tenable.io that can use the Exports API
  (Generally an Admin User)
* Service Account within Google Cloud that has the required permissions to
  edit findings and state (_Security Center Findings Editor_, and
  _Security Center Findings State Setter_ roles).
* A host to run the script on that can run a Python 3.x environment.  As this
  bridge talks cloud-to-cloud, where it is located does not matter.


### Installing
```shell
pip install tenable-cscc
```

### Setup

1. Add the Tenable.io CSCC Service from the [Marketplace][marketplace]
2. Copy the source id that was generated (we will use this later)
3. [Create a service key][create_key] for the account that was created
4. Create a new VM Instance to store the integration (Debian 9)
5. Download the installation script: `curl -o installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tenable/integration-cscc/master/install-tenable-cscc.sh`
6. Run the installer `chmod 755 installer.sh && sudo ./installer.sh`
7. Copy the service key onto the host (such as /etc/google-account.json).
8. Update the variables within the /etc/tenable-cscc.conf file.
9. Start the service `sudo systemctl start tenable-cscc`
