    """Calculate the amount of cable of neuron A within distance of neuron B.

    Uses dotproduct representation of a neuron! It is recommended to
    resample neurons first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a,b :       TreeNeuron | NeuronList
                Neuron(s) for which to compute cable within distance.
    dist :      int | float, optional
                Maximum distance.
    method :    'min' | 'max' | 'avg'
                Method by which to calculate the overlapping cable between
                two cables::

                  Assuming that neurons A and B have 300 and 150 um of cable
                  within given distances:

                    1. 'min' returns 150
                    2. 'max' returns 300
                    3. 'avg' returns 225

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
            Matrix in which neurons A are rows, neurons B are columns. Cable
            within distance is given in microns::

    --------
    :func:`navis.resample_neuron`
                Use to resample neurons before calculating overlap.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import navis
    >>> nl = navis.example_neurons(2)
    >>> # Resample to 1 micron
    >>> nl.resample(1000, inplace=True)
    >>> # Get overlapping cable within 2 microns
    >>> ol = navis.cable_overlap(nl, nl, dist=2000)
