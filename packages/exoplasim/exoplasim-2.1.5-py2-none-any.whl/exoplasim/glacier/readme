GPlaSim Glacier Model

Adiv Paradise -- 07.14.2017

Since we can grow our own glaciers and ice sheets, you
don't want PlaSim's default prescribed ice-related 
elevation for Antarctica and Greenland. The surface
file in this folder has their elevations decreased by 
~few km, so they're still above sea level, but not
by that much. If you put 3 km of ice on them, they'll
be back to normal elevation.
