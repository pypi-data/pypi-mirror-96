        `EasyBuild <https://easybuilders.github.io/easybuild>`_ is a software build
        and installation framework that allows you to manage (scientific) software
        on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in an efficient way.
        
        The **easybuild-easyconfigs** package provides a collection of well-tested
        example *easyconfig files* for EasyBuild.
        Easyconfig files are used to specify which software to build, which
        version of the software (and its dependencies), which build parameters
        to use (e.g., which compiler toolchain to use), etc.
        
        The EasyBuild documentation is available at http://easybuild.readthedocs.org/.
        
        The easybuild-easyconfigs package is hosted on GitHub, along
        with an issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests, see
        https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs.
