**CrysPy** is a crystallographic library for neutron data analysis. 
Based on the library *CrysPy* a script *RhoChi* allows to refine polarized neutron diffraction experiments 
performed with single crystals as well as with powder magnetic compounds. 

Main Features
-------------
- Analysis of the polarized neutron scattering on crystals by the library *CrysPy*;
- Diffraction data refinement for single crystals or powders by *RhoChi*;
- Free distributed software.
