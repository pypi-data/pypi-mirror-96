Description: # Ambio
        
        A light-weight bioinformatics library written in Python. It contains a variety of algorithms and functions that deal with strings.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run the following command in a terminal to install:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install ambio
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        - The `distance` module contains functions that calculate the Edit and Hamming distance between strings, plus other related methods.
        
        ```python
        from ambio import distance
        
        # returns the hamming distance between two strings,
        # if the two strings are not the same length, and Exception is raised
        print(distance.hammingDistance("helloworld", "ciaomondo!"))
        
        # returns the edit distance between the two strings
        print(distance.editDistance("sunday", "saturday"))
        
        # get the table with all the edit
        # distances between the possible substrings
        table = distance.generateEditDistanceTable("sunday", "saturday")
        
        # you can also pass an option to get a table of the coordinates of
        # the previous cell, this is useful for the backtracking process
        table, paths = distance.generateEditDistanceTable("sunday", "saturday", paths=True)
        
        # display the necessary edits to go from the first input string to the second. In this example,
        # s1: "s--unday"
        # s2: "saturday"
        s1, s2 = distance.displayEdits("sunday", "saturday")
        
        # by setting the 'compact' option to False, a list containing all the iterations
        # that go from the first string to the second is returned instead
        # in this case: ['sunday', 'saunday', 'satunday', 'saturday']
        steps = distance.displayEdits("sunday", "saturday", compact=False)
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        To install `ambio`, along with the tools you need to develop and run tests, run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install -e .[dev]
        ```
