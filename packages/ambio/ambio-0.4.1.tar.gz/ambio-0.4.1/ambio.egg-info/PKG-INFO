Description: # Ambio
        
        A light-weight bioinformatics library written in Python. It contains a variety of algorithms and functions that deal with strings.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run the following command in a terminal to install:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install ambio
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        - The `algs` module contains functions that calculate the Hamming distance between strings, and the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm for alignment, plus other related methods.
        
        ```python
        from ambio import algs
        
        # returns the hamming distance between two strings,
        # if the two strings are not the same length, and Exception is raised.
        hamming_distance = algs.hammingDistance("helloworld", "ciaomondo!"))
        
        # returns the alignment score of two strings, using the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm.
        score = algs.alignmentScore("sunday", "saturday"))
        
        # it's possible to tweak the weights of the algorithm:
        score = algs.alignmentScore(
            "sunday",
            "saturday",
            insertionDeletionWeight=-2,
            substitutionWeight=-1,
            matchWeight=1
        )
        
        # get the table with the scores between all the possible substrings.
        # it is always possible to tweak the weights.
        table = algs.alignmentScoreTable("sunday", "saturday")
        
        # you can also pass an option to get a table of the coordinates of
        # the previous cell, this is useful for the backtracking process
        table, paths = algs.alignmentScoreTable("sunday", "saturday", paths=True)
        
        # display the necessary edits to go from the first input string to the second.
        # again, it's possible to set the weights. In this example,
        # s1: "s--unday"
        # s2: "saturday"
        s1, s2 = distance.showAlignment("sunday", "saturday")
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        To install `ambio`, along with the tools you need to develop and run tests, run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install -e .
        ```
