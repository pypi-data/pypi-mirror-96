## Main Idea

Reading and sometimes understanding how to use [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) library an idea having something similar but really light in Python appears.

## Dependency 
This package does not depend on any other library. However Python atleast 3.5 is needed.

## Solution
This package allows to define functions (even async) which execution is deffered and such structures could be used as templates. Templates can call other templates. The call root function return a function which return an array of (usually) text items.

## Examples
Examples are available in notebooks directory, where Jupyter notebooks are stored. All of them are prepared for running in Google Colab.
