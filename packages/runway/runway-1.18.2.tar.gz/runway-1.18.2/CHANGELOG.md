## [Unreleased]

## [1.18.2] - 2021-02-24
### Fixed
- CloudFormation AWS Lambda build hook build errors when Docker left behind root-owned files

## [1.18.1] - 2021-01-14
### Fixed
- (binary builds) Support older glibc versions (e.g. Amazon Linux 2) by reverting Linux binary build platform to Ubuntu 18.04
  - Also pinning macOS build environment version explicitly in an attempt to prevent similiar issues there in the future


## [1.18.0] - 2021-01-13
### Added
- add `ecr` lookup to get information from either the runway or CFNgin config
  - currently only supports a query of `login-password` which returns the same value as the awscli command `aws ecr get-login-password`
- add `runway.cfngin.hooks.docker` to interact with docker by mimicking the functionality of the docker CLI. The following actions are currently supported
  - `docker.login`
    - options to simplify ECR authentication
  - `docker.image.build`
    - options to simplify building an image of ECR
  - `docker.image.push`
    - options to simplify pushing an image to ECR
- add `runway.cfngin.hooks.ecr.purge_repository` to remove all images in an ECR repository so it can be deleted by CloudFormation

## [1.17.0] - 2021-01-11
### Changed
- Broader dependency update for typedoc in sls-tsc sample.
- k8s sample repos: drop AmazonEKSServicePolicy managed policy use (unnecessary for clusters created starting 2020-04-16)

### Added
- Added [Flux](https://docs.fluxcd.io/) example repo (`gen-sample k8s-flux-repo`)

## [1.16.4] - 2020-12-22
### Fixed
- module type was being incorrectly determined via path extension with a higher priority than the explicit module type option
- fixed dependency conflict by bumping dependency versions of the sls-tsc sample. now using typedoc beta version to support typescript>=4.1.x.

## [1.16.3] - 2020-12-10
### Changed
- Bump python-hcl2 dependency requirement to reduce parsing failures

## [1.16.2] - 2020-12-07
### Changed
- CI fixes; no app change

## [1.16.1] - 2020-12-07
### Fixed
- fixed `TypeError` when Static Site is configured to use the S3 bucket to serve the website directly (e.g. CloudFront disabled)
- Newer kubectl versions download errors (now supporting sha1/256/512 checksum verification)

## [1.16.0] - 2020-11-09
### Added
- Static Site Auth@Edge: Add option to restrict access to a UserPool group

### Changed
- Static Site Auth@Edge: Better error pages
- Static Site Auth@Edge: Enhanced security via nonce signing

## [1.15.1] - 2020-10-19
### Changed
- CFNgin will now ignore *bitbucket-pipeline.yml* when finding config files
- *urllib3* pin broadened to `urllib3>=1.20,<1.26` to accommodate *botocore>=1.19*

## [1.15.0] - 2020-10-03
### Changed
- Cloudformation Jinja2 templates: updated render process to support custom filters

## [1.14.3] - 2020-09-30
### Fixed
- Static Site (non-Auth@Edge) deployment regression in v1.14

## [1.14.2] - 2020-09-28
### Changed
- (binary/npm versions only) bumped embedded awacs version to v0.9.9

## [1.14.1] - 2020-09-24
### Fixed
- Static Site Auth@Edge: fix non-idempotent deploys when deploying from different systems

## [1.14.0] - 2020-09-23
### Changed
- Static Site Auth@Edge: when domain aliases are specified, the CloudFront domain will no longer be added to the list of callback URLs
  - E.g. if `site.example.com` is provided as the site alias, logins will only work from `site.example.com` and not `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`
  - This should better match expected behavior, and has the advantage of being deterministic: the Cognito AppClient no longer has to be updated after creating the CloudFront distribution
  - Old behavior can be preserved via the new `staticsite_additional_redirect_domains` option
- Static Site: Drop state machine to cleanup replicated Lambda functions
  - Now Runway will log CLI commands that can be run to perform the cleanup once AWS allows them to be deleted
  - After updating the previous `SITENAME-cleanup` stack will be unused and can be deleted

  - logs that it will be created during the next `deploy`
  - continues without planning the stack if the template is too large to be used through the API, requiring an existing `cfngin_bucket`

## [1.11.0] - 2020-08-11
### Added
- custom per-backend (Terraform) handling is now supported
- Terraform remote backend has custom handling around pre-selecting a workspace, not switching workspace, and dumping parameters to a `runway-parameters.auto.tfvars.json` file (only option of variables with remote backend)
- Terraform workspaces can be specified with the `terraform_workspace` option (mainly needed for remote backend support)
- Terraform module parameters can now be dumped to a `auto.tfvars` using the `terraform_write_auto_tfvars` option (mainly needed for remote backend support)
- `cfn` Lookup usable in Runway and CFNgin config files
- the `runway_version` option can be used in the config to add a required Runway [version specifier](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#version-specifiers)
