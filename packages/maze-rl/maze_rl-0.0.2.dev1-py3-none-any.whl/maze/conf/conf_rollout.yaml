# Hydra is by default configured to create a fresh output directory for each run.
# However, to ensure model states, normalization stats and else are loaded from expected
# locations, we will change the dir back to the original working dir for the initialization
# (and then change it back so that all later script output lands in the hydra output dir as expected)
