Readme Renderer
===============

Readme Renderer is a library that will safely render arbitrary
``README`` files into HTML. It is designed to be used in Warehouse_ to
render the ``long_description`` for packages. It can handle Markdown,
reStructuredText (``.rst``), and plain text.

.. _Warehouse: https://github.com/pypa/warehouse


Check Description Locally
-------------------------

To locally check whether your long descriptions will render on PyPI, first
build your distributions, and then use the |twine check|_ command.


Render rST Description Locally
------------------------------

You can use ``readme_renderer`` on the command line to render an rST file as
HTML like this: ::

    python -m readme_renderer README.rst -o /tmp/README.html

Code of Conduct
---------------

Everyone interacting in the readme_renderer project's codebases, issue trackers,
chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the `PSF Code of Conduct`_.
