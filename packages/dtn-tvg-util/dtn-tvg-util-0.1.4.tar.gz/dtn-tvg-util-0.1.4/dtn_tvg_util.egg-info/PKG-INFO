Description: # dtn-tvg-util
        
        A Python module providing functions for the representation of DTNs based on time-varying network graphs. Supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.4+.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * Python 2.7 or 3.4+
        * a build toolchain for your platform plus the `python-dev` package to install the Python dependencies
        * to place Ring Road ground stations, `libgeos-dev` and `libgdal-dev`
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        First you have to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
        
        ```
        python3 -m venv --without-pip .venv
        curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | .venv/bin/python
        source .venv/bin/activate
        pip install -e .
        pip install -U -r requirements-ring-road.txt
        ```
        
        Some example tools can be found in `tvgutil.tools`. These scripts allow to generate and convert time-varying graph representations of Ring Road [1] scenarios.
        
        You may skip installing dependencies from `requirements-ring-road.txt` (the last line) if you don't want to use these tools or generate such scenarios.
        
        ## Testing
        
        Unit tests for the core functionality are provided in `test/`. They are based on the Python `unittest` package. Use a test runner of your choice to execute them, e.g. `pytest` or `nose`.
        
        ```
        pip install nose
        python -m nose test
        ```
