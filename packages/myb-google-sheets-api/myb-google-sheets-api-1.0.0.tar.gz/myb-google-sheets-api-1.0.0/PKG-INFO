        ## Releases
        
        Releases should follow a [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme. 
        
        When changes have been made that warrant a new release that should be published, modify the `__version__` in [`setup.py`](setup.py) 
        
        After the change is merged to the `main` branch, go to [releases](https://github.com/mine-your-business/myb-google-sheets-api/releases) and `Draft a new release`. The `Tag version` should follow the pattern `v1.0.0` and should `Target` the `main` branch. 
        
        The `Release title` should not include the `v` from the tag and should have a reasonably detailed description of the new release's changes. 
        
        Once the release has been published, the [`.github/workflows/python-publish.yml`](.github/workflows/python-publish.yml) GitHub Actions Workflow should trigger and automatically upload the new version to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) using GitHub secrets credentials stored with the [Mine Your Business GitHub Organization](https://github.com/mine-your-business).
