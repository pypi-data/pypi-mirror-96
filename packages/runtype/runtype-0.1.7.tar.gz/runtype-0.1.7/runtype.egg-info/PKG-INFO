Description: 
        runtype is composed of several utility modules:
        
        1. dispatch - Provides a decorator for fast multi-dispatch at run-time for functions, with sophisticated ambiguity resolution.
        
        2. dataclass - Improves on Python's existing dataclass, by verifying the type-correctness of its attributes at run-time. Also provides a few useful methods for dataclasses.
        
        3. isa - Provides alternative functions to `isinstance` and `issubclass`, that understand Python's `typing` module.
        
        Runtype's integration with the `typing` module allows to use type signatures such as `List[int]`, `Optional[str]`, or `Union[int, str, Callable]`.
