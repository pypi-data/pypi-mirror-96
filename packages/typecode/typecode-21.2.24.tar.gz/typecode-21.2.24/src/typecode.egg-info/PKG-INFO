        TypeCode provides comprehensive filetype and mimetype detection using multiple
        detectors including libmagic (included as a dependency for Linux, Windows and
        macOS) and Pygments. It started as library in scancode-toolkit.

        To run unit tests::
        
            pytest -vvs -n 2
