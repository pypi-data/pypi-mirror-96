SQLFluff is a dialect-flexible and configurable SQL linter. Designed with ELT applications in mind, SQLFluff also works with jinja templating and dbt. SQLFluff will auto-fix most linting errors, allowing you to focus your time on what matters.


# Getting Started

To get started, install the package and run `sqlfluff lint` or `sqlfluff fix`.

```shell
$ pip install sqlfluff
$ echo "  SELECT a  +  b FROM tbl;  " > test.sql
$ sqlfluff lint test.sql
== [test.sql] FAIL
L:   1 | P:   1 | L003 | Single indentation uses a number of spaces not a multiple of 4
L:   1 | P:  14 | L006 | Operators should be surrounded by a single space unless at the start/end of a line
L:   1 | P:  27 | L001 | Unnecessary trailing whitespace
```
