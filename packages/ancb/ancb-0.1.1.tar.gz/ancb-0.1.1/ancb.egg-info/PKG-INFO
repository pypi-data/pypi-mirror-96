Description: Another NumPy Circular Buffer (or ANCB for short) is an attempt to make a circular buffer work with NumPy ufuncs for
        real-time data processing. One can think of a NumpyCircularbuffer in ANCB as being a fixed length deque with random access
        functionality (unlike the deque). For users more familar with NumPy, one can think of this buffer as a way of automatically
        rolling the array into the right order.
        
        ANCB was developed by Drason "Emmy" Chow during their time as an undergraduate researcher at IU: Bloomington for use in 
        making [Savitzky-Golay filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter), which take an array of positions in chronological or reverse-chronological order and produce
        estimates of velocity, acceleration, and possibly higher order derivatives if desired.
