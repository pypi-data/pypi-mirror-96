twill: a simple scripting language for web browsing
===================================================

twill is a simple scripting language intended for programmatic or automated browsing of web sites.

The current version 2.0 of twill is based on the latest 1.8 version which uses [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/) and [lxml](https://lxml.de/) instead of [mechanize](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/), plus ideas from other forks and add-ons like [retwill](https://bitbucket.org/brandizzi/retwill/) or [flunc](https://www.coactivate.org/projects/flunc/project-home). This version supports Python version 2.7 and 3.5 to 3.9. There are also plans to create a version 3.0 of twill that will support only Python 3.6 or higher.

See the [changelog](https://twill-tools.github.io/twill/changelog.html) for a summary of the things that have been changed and improved in version 2.0.

The [documentation](https://twill-tools.github.io/twill/) is included in the distribution and provided online.
