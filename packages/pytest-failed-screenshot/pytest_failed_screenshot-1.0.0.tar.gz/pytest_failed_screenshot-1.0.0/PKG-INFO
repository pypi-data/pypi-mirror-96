        =======================================
        
        For UI automation test cases using selenium and appium, screenshots are
        saved when they fail, and are attached to the report when allure is used
        
        install
        =======
        
        ``pip install pytest-failed-screenshot``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        command line:``pytest --screenshot={on:off} --screenshot_path={on:off:absolute path}``
        
        
        * - options:
          - screenshot: Used to open plugin, default "off"
          - screenshot_path:
             - off: The default is 'off'.The screenshot will not be saved and will only be attached to the allure report.
             - on: The screenshots will be saved to the "./screenshot/%Y-%m-%d/" directory in the root path of the project.
               If the directory has historical screenshots, the historical screenshots will be archived, moved to the
               "./screenshot/history/%Y-%m-%d/{times}" directory, and attached to the allure report
             - Absolute path: The screenshot will be saved in that path and attached to the report.
        
        
        Demo
        ====
        
        The driver instances of selenium and appium must be transferred by a
        fixture.
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import pytest
            from selenium import webdriver
        
        
            @pytest.fixture()
            def init_driver():
                driver = webdriver.Chrome()
                yield driver
                driver.close()
                driver.quit()
        
        
            def test_login_success(init_driver):
                init_driver.get("https://github.com/fungaegis/pytest-failed-screenshot")
                assert False
        
        
        command: ``pytest --screenshot=on --screenshot_path=on``
        
        tip: Support the use of pytest-xdist together
