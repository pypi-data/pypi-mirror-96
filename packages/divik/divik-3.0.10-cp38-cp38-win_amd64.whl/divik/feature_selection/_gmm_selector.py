    """Feature selector that removes low- or high- mean or variance features

    Gaussian Mixture Modeling is applied to the features' characteristics
    and components are obtained. Crossing points of the components are
    considered candidate thresholds. Out of these up to ``n_candidates``
    components are removed in such a way that at least ``min_features`` or
    ``min_features_rate`` features are retained.

    This feature selection algorithm looks only at the features (X), not the
    desired outputs (y), and can thus be used for unsupervised learning.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stat: {'mean', 'var'}
        Kind of statistic to be computed out of the feature.

    use_log: bool, optional, default: False
        Whether to use the logarithm of feature characteristic instead of the
        characteristic itself. This may improve feature filtering performance,
        depending on the distribution of features, however all the
        characteristics (mean, variance) have to be positive for that -
        filtering will fail otherwise. This is useful for specific cases in
        biology where the distribution of data may actually require this option
        for any efficient filtering.

    n_candidates: int, optional, default: None
        How many candidate thresholds to use at most. ``0`` preserves all the
        features (all candidate thresholds are discarded), ``None`` allows to
        remove all but one component (all candidate thresholds are retained).
        Negative value means to discard up to all but ``-n_candidates``
        candidates, e.g. ``-1`` will retain at least two components (one
        candidate threshold is removed).

    min_features: int, optional, default: 1
        How many features must be preserved. Candidate thresholds are tested
        against this value, and if they retain less features, less conservative
        thresholds is selected.

    min_features_rate: float, optional, default: 0.0
        Similar to ``min_features`` but relative to the input data features
        number.

    preserve_high: bool, optional, default: True
        Whether to preserve the high-characteristic features or
        low-characteristic ones.

    max_components: int, optional, default: 10
        The maximum number of components used in the GMM decomposition.

    Attributes
    ----------
    vals_: array, shape (n_features,)
        Computed characteristic of each feature.

    threshold_: float
        Threshold value to filter the features by the characteristic.

    raw_threshold_: float
        Threshold value mapped back to characteristic space (no logarithm, etc.)

    selected_: array, shape (n_features,)
        Vector of binary selections of the informative features.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import divik.feature_selection as fs
    >>> np.random.seed(42)
    >>> labels = np.concatenate([30 * [0] + 20 * [1] + 30 * [2] + 40 * [3]])
    >>> data = labels * 5 + np.random.randn(*labels.shape)
    >>> fs.GMMSelector('mean').fit_transform(data)
    array([[14.78032811 15.35711257 ... 15.75193303]])
    >>> fs.GMMSelector('mean', preserve_high=False).fit_transform(data)
    array([[ 0.49671415 -0.1382643  ... -0.29169375]])
    >>> fs.GMMSelector('mean', n_discard=-1).fit_transform(data)
    array([[10.32408397  9.61491772 ... 15.75193303]])
