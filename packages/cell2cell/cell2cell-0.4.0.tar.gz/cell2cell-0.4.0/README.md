# Inferring cell-cell interactions from transcriptomes with *cell2cell*
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/cell2cell.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/cell2cell/)


## Installation
Create a new conda environment:
```
conda create -n cell2cell -y python=3.7 jupyter
```

Activate that environment:

```
conda activate cell2cell
```

Then, install cell2cell:
```
pip install cell2cell
```

## Examples

- A toy example containing main standard analyses is [available here](./examples/Toy-Example.ipynb)
- An example of using *cell2cell* to infer cell-cell interactions across the whole
body of *C. elegans* is [available here](https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/Celegans-cell2cell)
