def hypergeom_representation(sample_size, class_in_sample, population_size, class_in_population):
    '''
    This function performs an analysis of enrichment/depletion based on observation in a sample. It computes a p-value
    given a hypergeometric distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_size : int
        Size of the sample obtained or number of elements obtained from the analysis.

    class_in_sample : int
        Number of elements of a given class that are contained in the sample. This is the class to be tested.

    population_size : int
        Size of the sampling space. That is, the total number of possible elements to be chosen when sampling.

    class_in_population : int
        Number of elements of a given class that are contained in the population. This is the class to be tested.

    Returns
    -------
    p_vals : tuple
        A tuple containing the p-values for depletion and enrichment analysis, respectively.
