"""Information-based connectivity metrics and utility functions.

This submodule contains two types of functions :

1. **Connectivity metrics :** methods to estimate either the undirected or
   directed connectivity. Some methods are performed within-trials and others
   across-trials. In the case of within-trials metrics, it is then possible to
   estimate if the connectivity is modulated by the task by passing the
   connectivity arrays to `frites.workflow.WfMi`
2. **Connectivity related utility functions :** small utility functions that
   work on connectivity arrays
