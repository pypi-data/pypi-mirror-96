Rules are added using the '-r' and '-R'. options.  Each rule is specified in
string form in the format '[!][{+-=}][<area>][:<id>]':

* a leading '!' (or not) specifies the action for this rule: a '!' indicates
  the rule should exclude matching elements; if the character is omitted, they
  should be included

* next (or first, if '!' is not specified) indicates the 'action' being
  matched:

    '+' - add/create/set actions,,
    '-' - remove/delete/unset actions, and
    '=' - update actions (changing an already-set value for another)

The list of rules starts empty, with the default case being to include the
element.

The '-e' option is useful for displaying the rules which would match included
difference output.
