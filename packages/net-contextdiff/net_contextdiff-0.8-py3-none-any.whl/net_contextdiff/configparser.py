    configuration file using indented contexts.

    It includes the context in which it occurs (the indented block), a
    regular expression to match it (which will include groups to extract
    parameters from), if it enters a subcontext and an action method to
    run, if there is a match (which might store configuration
    information).

    Actual commands will inherit from this and override or implement
    some of the constants:

    * context - the context (indented section name) in which the command
      applies; the default is '.', which represents the top level (no
      indent, i.e. no subcontext)

    * cmd - an uncompiled regular expression string which fully matches
      (with re.fullmatch()) the command, case insensitively

    * enter_context - if not Null, it will be a string specifying the
      subcontext to enter, if the command matches

    In addtion, the action() method is likely to need to be implemented.

        matched.  It will typically be used to update the configuration
        dictionary.

        The default is not to do anything - child classes will likely
        need to implement this.

        The configuration dictionary supplied to this function is not
        necessarily the entire configuration for the device but what is
        returned by the action() method of the parent context.  This
        allows a parent context to pass on just the configuration
        dictionary for a portion of the device, such as an individual
        interface.  This makes it easier to update the correct portion
        of the configuration, without having to index through the entire
        structure.

        In addition, a dictionary of 'parameters' are supplied to the
        action() method.  This is cumulative over the parent contexts
        and can be used to record things like the interface name
        entered.  This may not be required, if the configuration
        dictionary for that element is sufficient, but is useful where
        the subcontext need to know something about a command in a
        parent context.  When subcontexts are exited, the parameters for
        the parent context are restored.

        Keyword arguments:

        groups -- the re.Match.groupdict() returned after matching the
        command regular expression

        cfg -- the dictionary for this part of the configuration, or the
        the full configuration, as returned by the parent context's
        action() method

        params -- the stored parameters for this context

        The return value is the dictionary to use as the 'cfg' argument
        of any subcontext action() calls, or None if the same
        configuration dictionary as the parent context is to be used.

    the commands which are applicable in this context the configuration
