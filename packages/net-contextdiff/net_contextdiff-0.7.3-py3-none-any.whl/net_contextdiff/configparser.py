        # Command parsing is handled through a dictionary indexed by
        # the name of the current context (contexts are begun and end
        # with the levels of indent).  Each item in this dictionary is
        # a list of dictionaries: one item in the list for each command
        # matched in this context, containing the following mandatory
        # keys:
        #
        #   * command -- a string giving an uncompiled regular
        #     expression for a command, to match against lines in this
        #     context; if this matches, the command is considered
        #     "found" and no further commands are checked for, so it
        #     must be adequately specified to not match the wrong
        #     command; an implicit '^' and '$' surround the expression
        #     and leading whitespace is also removed
        #
        #   * re -- the compiled regular expression, constructed from
        #     re.compile() of the textual command 'command'; the add_-
        #     command() method automatically sets this
        #
        # There are also two optional keys:
        #
        #   * action -- this is a function to be called when the line
        #     matches this command; three parameters will be supplied (below)
        #
        #   * new_context -- if the command matches, the current
        #     context will be changed to this to parse commands in
        #     child contexts; commands with no child contexts can just
        #     omit this
        #
        # The action function takes three arguments
        #
        #   * match -- a dictionary (obtained with re.match.groupdict()) for
        #     the groups matched in the regular expression 're'
        #
        #   * contextconfig -- a reference to part of the configuration
        #     dictionary appropriate to the context the command is in
        #     (a structure under self._config) to make it easy to modify that
        #     portion of the configuration; this typically set to the same as
        #     params["config"], if it exists, or None, if not, defined by the
        #     command which caused the context to be entered
        #
        #Â   * params -- a dictionary of the parameters applying to the
        #     current context: action functions from parent contexts
        #     can modify this to record information parsed from their
        #     command lines - e.g. the "vlan ..." command can record
        #     the tag number in their params dictionary which is then
        #     passed to any action functions in the child contexts;
        #     they are, thus, cumulative
