**Introduction**
----------------

`Zillion` is a free, open data warehousing and dimensional modeling tool that
allows combining and analyzing data from multiple datasources through a simple
API. It writes SQL so you don't have to, and it easily bolts onto existing
database infrastructure via SQLAlchemy.

With `Zillion` you can:

* Define a warehouse that contains a variety of SQL and/or file-like
  datasources
* Define or reflect metrics, dimensions, and relationships in your data
* Run multi-datasource reports and combine the results in a DataFrame
* Flexibly aggregate your data with multi-level rollups and table pivots
* Customize or combine fields with formulas
* Apply technical transformations including rolling, cumulative, and rank
  statistics
* Apply automatic type conversions - i.e. get a "year" dimension for free
  from a "date" column
* Save and share report specifications
* Utilize ad hoc or public datasources, tables, and fields to enrich reports

**Primer**
----------

The following is meant to give a quick overview of some theory and
nomenclature used in data warehousing with `Zillion`. Skip below for a
quickstart [example](#example-sales-analytics).

In short: `Zillion` writes SQL for you and makes data accessible through a very
simple API:

```python
result = warehouse.execute(
    metrics=["revenue", "leads"],
    dimensions=["date"],
    criteria=[
        ("date", ">", "2020-01-01"),
        ("partner", "=", "Partner A")
    ]
)
```

<a name="metrics-and-dimensions"></a>

### **Metrics and Dimensions**

In `Zillion` there are two main types of `Fields` that will be used in
your report requests:

1. `Dimensions`: attributes of data used for labelling, grouping, and filtering
2. `Metrics`: facts and measures that may be broken down along dimensions

A `Field` encapsulates the concept of a column in your data. For example, you
may have a `Field` called "revenue". That `Field` may occur across several
datasources or possibly in multiple tables within a single
datasource. `Zillion` understands that all of those columns represent the same
concept, and it can try to use any of them to satisfy reports requesting
"revenue".

Likewise there are two main types of tables used to structure your warehouse:

1. `Dimension Tables`: reference/attribute tables containing only related
dimensions
2. `Metric Tables`: fact tables that may contain metrics and some related
dimensions/attributes

Dimension tables are often static or slowly growing in terms of row count and contain
attributes tied to a primary key. Some common examples would be lists of US Zip Codes or
company/partner directories.

Metric tables are generally more transactional in nature. Some common examples
would be records for web requests, ecommerce sales, or stock market price history.

<a name="warehouse-theory"></a>

### **Warehouse Theory**

If you really want to go deep on dimensional modeling and the drill-across
querying technique `Zillion` employs, I recommend reading Ralph Kimball's
[book](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/books/data-warehouse-dw-toolkit/)
on data warehousing.

To summarize, [drill-across
querying](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/drilling-across/)
forms one or more queries to satisfy a report request for `metrics` that may
exist across multiple datasources and/or tables at a particular `dimension`
grain.

`Zillion` technically supports
[snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_schema) or
[star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_schema) schemas, though it isn't
picky about it. You can specify table relationships through a parent-child
lineage, and `Zillion` can also infer acceptable joins based on the presence
of dimension table primary keys.

<a name="query-layers"></a>

### **Query Layers**

`Zillion` reports can be thought of as running in two layers:

1. `DataSource Layer`: SQL queries against the warehouse's datasources
2. `Combined Layer`: A final SQL query against the combined data from the
DataSource Layer

The Combined Layer is just another SQL database (in-memory SQLite by default)
that is used to tie the datasource data together and apply a few additional
features such as rollups, row filters, row limits, sorting, pivots, and technical computations.

---

<a name="executing-reports"></a>

### **Executing Reports**

The main purpose of `Zillion` is to execute reports against a `Warehouse`.
You'll see how to initialize a `Warehouse` in a bit, but at a high level
you will be crafting reports as follows:

```python
result = warehouse.execute(
    metrics=["revenue", "leads"],
    dimensions=["date"],
    criteria=[
        ("date", ">", "2020-01-01"),
        ("partner", "=", "Partner A")
    ]
)
print(result.df) # Pandas DataFrame
```

When comparing to writing SQL, it's helpful to think of the dimensions as the
target columns of a **group by** SQL statement. Think of the metrics as the
columns you are **aggregating**. Think of the criteria as the **where
clause**. Your criteria are applied in the DataSource Layer SQL queries.

The `ReportResult` has a Pandas DataFrame with the dimensions as the index and
the metrics as the columns.

A `Report` is said to have a `grain`, which defines the dimensions each metric
must be able to join to in order to satisfy the `Report` requirements. The
`grain` is a combination of **all** dimensions, including those referenced in
criteria or in metric formulas. In the example above, the `grain` would be
`{date, partner}`. Both "revenue" and "leads" must be able to join to those
dimensions for this report to be possible.

These concepts can take time to sink in and obviously vary with the specifics
of your data model, but you will become more familiar with them as you start
putting together reports against your data warehouses.

<a name="example-sales-analytics"></a>

**Example - Sales Analytics**
-----------------------------

Below we will walk through a simple hypothetical sales data model that
demonstrates basic `DataSource` and `Warehouse` configuration and then shows
some sample [reports](#example-reports). The data is a simple SQLite database
that is part of the `Zillion` test code. For reference, the schema is as
follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE partners (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE campaigns (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  category VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  partner_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE leads (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  campaign_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE sales (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  item VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
  revenue DECIMAL(10, 2),
  lead_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

<a name="example-warehouse-creation"></a>

### **Warehouse Creation**

A `Warehouse` may be created from an existing SQLAlchemy MetaData instance,
purely from a JSON configuration, or a combination of the two. The code below
shows how it can be done in as little as one line of code if you have a pointer
to a JSON `Warehouse` config.

> *Note*: Defining your config in JSON is recommended, so we'll save an example
of defining `Zillion` metadata directly on your SQLAlchemy objects for another
time.

```python
from zillion import Warehouse

wh = Warehouse(config="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/totalhack/zillion/master/examples/example_wh_config.json")
```

This example config uses a `data_url` in its `DataSource` `connect` info that
tells `Zillion` to dynamically download that data and connect to it as a
SQLite database. This is useful for quick examples or analysis, though in most
scenarios you would put a connection string to an existing database like you
see
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/totalhack/zillion/master/tests/test_mysql_ds_config.json)

The basics of `Zillion's` configuration structure are as follows:

A `Warehouse` config has the following main sections:

* `metrics`: optional list of metric configs for global metrics
* `dimensions`: optional list of dimension configs for global dimensions
* `datasources`: mapping of datasource names to datasource configs or config URLs

A `DataSource` config has the following main sections:

* `connect`: database connection url or dict of connect params
* `metrics`: optional list of metric configs specific to this datasource
* `dimensions`: optional list of dimension configs specific to this datasource
* `tables`: mapping of table names to table configs or config URLs

> Tip: datasource and table configs may also be replaced with a URL that points
to a local or remote config file.

In this example all four tables in our database are included in the config,
two as dimension tables and two as metric tables. The tables are linked
through a parent->child relationship: partners to campaigns, and leads to
sales.  Some tables also utilize the `create_fields` flag to automatically
create `Fields` on the datasource from column definitions. Other metrics and
dimensions are defined explicitly.

To view the structure of this `Warehouse` after init you can use the `print_info`
method which shows all metrics, dimensions, tables, and columns that are part
of your data warehouse:

```python
wh.print_info() # Formatted print of the Warehouse structure
```

For a deeper dive of the config schema please see the full
[docs](https://totalhack.github.io/zillion/zillion.configs/).

<a name="example-reports"></a>

### **Reports**

**Example:** Get sales, leads, and revenue by partner:

```python
result = wh.execute(
    metrics=["sales", "leads", "revenue"],
    dimensions=["partner_name"]
)

print(result.df)
"""
              sales  leads  revenue
partner_name
Partner A        11      4    165.0
Partner B         2      2     19.0
Partner C         5      1    118.5
"""
```

**Example:** Let's limit to Partner A and break down by its campaigns:

```python
result = wh.execute(
    metrics=["sales", "leads", "revenue"],
    dimensions=["campaign_name"],
    criteria=[("partner_name", "=", "Partner A")]
)

print(result.df)
"""
               sales  leads  revenue
campaign_name
Campaign 1A        5      2       83
Campaign 2A        6      2       82
"""
```

**Example:** The output below shows rollups at the campaign level within each
partner, and also a rollup of totals at the partner and campaign level.

> *Note:* the output contains a special character to mark DataFrame rollup rows
that were added to the result. The
[ReportResult](https://totalhack.github.io/zillion/zillion.report/#reportresult)
object contains some helper attributes to automatically access or filter
rollups, as well as a `df_display` attribute that returns the result with
friendlier display values substituted for special characters. The
under-the-hood special character is left here for illustration, but may not
render the same in all scenarios.

```python
from zillion import RollupTypes

result = wh.execute(
    metrics=["sales", "leads", "revenue"],
    dimensions=["partner_name", "campaign_name"],
    rollup=RollupTypes.ALL
)

print(result.df)
"""
                            sales  leads  revenue
partner_name campaign_name
Partner A    Campaign 1A      5.0    2.0     83.0
             Campaign 2A      6.0    2.0     82.0
             􏿿               11.0    4.0    165.0
Partner B    Campaign 1B      1.0    1.0      6.0
             Campaign 2B      1.0    1.0     13.0
             􏿿                2.0    2.0     19.0
Partner C    Campaign 1C      5.0    1.0    118.5
             􏿿                5.0    1.0    118.5
􏿿            􏿿               18.0    7.0    302.5
"""
```

See the `Report`
[docs](https://totalhack.github.io/zillion/zillion.report/#report) for more
information on supported rollup behavior.

**Example:** Save a report spec (not the data):

First you must make sure you have saved your `Warehouse`, as saved reports
are scoped to a particular `Warehouse` ID. To save a `Warehouse`
you must provide a URL that points to the complete config.

```python
name = "My Unique Warehouse Name"
config_url = <some url pointing to a complete warehouse config>
wh.save(name, config_url) # wh.id is populated after this

spec_id = wh.save_report(
    metrics=["sales", "leads", "revenue"],
    dimensions=["partner_name"]
)
```

> *Note*: If you built your `Warehouse` in python from a list of `DataSources`,
or passed in a `dict` for the `config` param on init, there currently is not
a built-in way to output a complete config to a file for reference when saving.

**Example:** Load and run a report from a spec ID:

```python
result = wh.execute_id(spec_id)
```

> *Note:* The ZILLION_CONFIG environment var can point to a yaml config file.
The database used to store Zillion report specs can be configured by setting
the ZILLION_DB_URL value in your Zillion config to a valid database connection
string. By default a SQLite DB in /tmp is used. See this [sample
config](https://github.com/totalhack/zillion/blob/master/examples/sample_config.yaml).

**Example:** Unsupported Grain

If you attempt an impossible report, you will get an
`UnsupportedGrainException`. The report below is impossible because it
attempts to break down the leads metric by a dimension that only exists
in a child table. Generally speaking, child tables can join back up to
parents to find dimensions, but not the other way around.

```python
# Fails with UnsupportedGrainException
result = wh.execute(
    metrics=["leads"],
    dimensions=["sale_id"]
)
```

**Advanced Topics**
-------------------

<a name="formula-metrics"></a>

### **Formula Metrics**

In our example above our config included a formula-based metric called "rpl",
which is simply `revenue / leads`. A `FormulaMetric` combines other metrics
and/or dimensions to calculate a new metric at the Combined Layer of
querying. The syntax must match your Combined Layer database, which is SQLite
in our example.

```json
{
    "name": "rpl",
    "aggregation": "mean",
    "rounding": 2,
    "formula": "{revenue}/{leads}"
}
```

<a name="datasource-formulas"></a>

### **DataSource Formulas**

Our example also includes a metric "sales" whose value is calculated via
formula at the DataSource Layer of querying. Note the following in the
`fields` list for the "id" param in the "main.sales" table. These formulas are
in the syntax of the particular `DataSource` database technology, which also
happens to be SQLite in our example.

```json
"fields": [
    "sale_id",
    {"name":"sales", "ds_formula": "COUNT(DISTINCT sales.id)"}
]
```

<a name="type-conversions"></a>

### **Type Conversions**

Our example also automatically created a handful of dimensions from the
"created_at" columns of the leads and sales tables. Support for automatic type
conversions is limited, but for date/datetime columns in supported
`DataSource` technologies you can get a variety of dimensions for free this
way.

The output of `wh.print_info` will show the added dimensions, which are
prefixed with "lead_" or "sale_" as specified by the optional
`type_conversion_prefix` in the config for each table. Some examples of
auto-generated dimensions in our example warehouse include sale_hour,
sale_day_name, sale_month, sale_year, etc. 

As an optimization in the where clause of underlying report queries, `Zillion` 
will try to apply conversions to criteria values instead of columns. For example, 
it is generally more efficient to query as `my_datetime > '2020-01-01' and my_datetime < '2020-01-02'`
instead of `DATE(my_datetime) == '2020-01-01'`, because the latter can prevent index
usage in many database technologies. The ability to apply conversions to values
instead of columns varies by field and `DataSource` technology as well. 

To prevent type conversions, set `skip_conversion_fields` to `true` on your
`DataSource` config.

See `zillion.field.TYPE_ALLOWED_CONVERSIONS` and `zillion.field.DIALECT_CONVERSIONS`
for more details on currently supported conversions.

<a name="config-variables"></a>

### **Config Variables**

If you'd like to avoid putting sensitive connection information directly in
your `DataSource` configs you can leverage config variables. In your `Zillion`
yaml config you can specify a `DATASOURCE_CONTEXTS` section as follows:

```yaml
DATASOURCE_CONTEXTS:
  my_ds_name:
    user: user123
    pass: goodpassword
    host: 127.0.0.1
    schema: reporting
```

Then when your `DataSource` config for the datasource named "my_ds_name" is
read, it can use this context to populate variables in your connection url:

```json
"datasources": {
    "my_ds_name": {
        "connect": "mysql+pymysql://{user}:{pass}@{host}/{schema}"
        ...
    }
}
```

<a name="DataSource Priority"></a>

### **DataSource Priority**

On `Warehouse` init you can specify a default priority order for datasources
by name. This will come into play when a report could be satisfied by multiple
datasources. `DataSources` earlier in the list will be higher priority. This
would be useful if you wanted to favor a set of faster, aggregate tables that
are grouped in a `DataSource`.

```python
wh = Warehouse(config=config, ds_priority=["aggr_ds", "raw_ds", ...])
```

<a name="adhoc-metrics"></a>

### **Ad Hoc Metrics**

You may also define metrics "ad hoc" with each report request. Below is an
example that creates a revenue-per-lead metric on the fly. These only exist
within the scope of the report, and the name can not conflict with any existing
fields:

```python
result = wh.execute(
    metrics=[
        "leads",
        {"formula": "{revenue}/{leads}", "name": "my_rpl"}
    ],
    dimensions=["partner_name"]
)
```

<a name="adhoc-tables"></a>

### **Ad Hoc Tables**

`Zillion` also supports creation or syncing of ad hoc tables in your database
during `DataSource` or `Warehouse` init. An example of a table config that
does this is shown
[here](https://github.com/totalhack/zillion/blob/master/tests/test_adhoc_ds_config.json).
It uses the table config's `data_url` and `if_exists` params to control the
syncing and/or creation of the "main.dma_zip" table from a remote CSV in a
SQLite database.  The same can be done in other database types too.

The potential performance drawbacks to such an approach should be obvious,
particularly if you are initializing your warehouse often or if the remote
data file is large. It is often better to sync and create your data ahead of
time so you have complete schema control, but this method can be very useful
in certain scenarios.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: be careful not to overwrite existing tables in your database!

<a name="technicals"></a>

### **Technicals**

There are a variety of technical computations that can be applied to metrics to
compute rolling, cumulative, or rank statistics. For example, to compute a 5-point
moving average on revenue one might define a new metric as follows:

```json
{
    "name": "revenue_ma_5",
    "type": "numeric(10,2)",
    "aggregation": "sum",
    "rounding": 2,
    "technical": "mean(5)"
}
```

Technical computations are computed at the Combined Layer, whereas the "aggregation"
is done at the DataSource Layer (hence needing to define both above). 

For more info on how shorthand technical strings are parsed, see the
[parse_technical_string](https://totalhack.github.io/zillion/zillion.configs/#parse_technical_string)
code. For a full list of supported technical types see
`zillion.core.TechnicalTypes`.

Technicals also support two modes: "group" and "all". The mode controls how to
apply the technical computation across the data's dimensions. In "group" mode,
it computes the technical across the last dimension, whereas in "all" mode in
computes the technical across all data without any regard for dimensions.

The point of this becomes more clear if you try to do a "cumsum" technical
across data broken down by something like ["partner_name", "date"]. If "group"
mode is used (the default in most cases) it will do cumulative sums *within*
each partner over the date ranges. If "all" mode is used, it will do a
cumulative sum across every data row. You can be explicit about the mode by
appending it to the technical string: i.e. "cumsum:all" or "mean(5):group"

<a name="supported-datasources"></a>

**Supported DataSources**
-------------------------

`Zillion's` goal is to support any database technology that SQLAlchemy
supports. That said the support and testing levels in `Zillion` vary at the
moment. In particular, the ability to do type conversions, database
reflection, and kill running queries all require some database-specific code
for support. The following list summarizes known support levels. Your mileage
may vary with untested database technologies that SQLAlchemy supports (it
might work just fine, just hasn't been tested yet). Please report bugs and
help add more support!

* SQLite: supported and tested
* MySQL: supported and tested
* PostgreSQL: supported and *lightly* tested
* MSSQL: not tested, but support is planned
* Oracle: not tested, but support is planned
* BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, etc: not tested, but support is planned

Note that this is different than the database support for the Combined Layer
database. Currently only SQLite is supported there, though it is planned to
make this more generic such that any SQLAlchemy supported database could be
used.

<a name="multiprocess-considerations"></a>

**Multiprocess Considerations**
-------------------------------

If you plan to run `Zillion` in a multiprocess scenario, whether on a single
node or across multiple nodes, there are a couple of things to consider:

* SQLite DataSources do not scale well and may run into locking issues with multiple processes trying to access them on the same node.
* Any file-based database technology that isn't centrally accessible would be challenging when using multiple nodes.
* Ad Hoc DataSource and Ad Hoc Table downloads should be avoided as they may conflict/repeat across each process. Offload this to an external
ETL process that is better suited to manage those data flows in a scalable production scenario.

Note that you can still use the default SQLite in-memory Combined Layer DB without issues, as that is made on the fly with each report request and
requires no coordination/communication with other processes or nodes.
