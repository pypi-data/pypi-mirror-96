PRIMAP2 is the next generation of the PRIMAP climate policy analysis suite.
PRIMAP2 is free software, you are welcome to use it in your own research.
The documentation can be found at https://primap2.readthedocs.io.

Structure
---------

PRIMAP2 is:
 * A flexible and powerful data format built on `xarray <https://xarray.pydata.org>`_.
 * A collection of functions for common tasks when wrangling climate policy
   data, like aggregation and interpolation.
 * A format for data packages built on `datalad <https://www.datalad.org>`_, providing
   metadata extraction and search on a collection of data packages.

Status
------

PRIMAP2 is in active development, and not everything promised above is built
yet.

=========
Changelog
=========

0.4.0
-----
* Add the ``da.pr.set()`` and ``ds.pr.set()`` functions for overwriting / infilling /
  extending data.
* Allow for more than one source in a single Dataset / DataArray.
* Support xarray 0.17, and therefore drop support for Python 3.6.

0.3.1
-----
* Re-release 0.3.0 to trigger zenodo.

0.3.0
-----
* Add functions for downscaling and aggregation of gas baskets and categorical baskets.
* Add functions, docs, and tests for basic GWP handling.
* Add Makefile target to generate patched stub files for xarray containing the primap2
  API.
* Add development documentation detailing the structure of the repository and the tools
  used to development of PRIMAP2.
* Add selection and indexing which understands dimension names like ``area`` in addition
  to the full dimension key including the category set like ``area (ISO3)``. Works with
  ``ds.pr[key]`` and ``ds.pr.loc[selection]`` as well as ``da.pr.loc[selection]``.
* Add usage documentation for all currently included functionality.
* Access metadata easily via properties like ``ds.pr.references``.

0.2.0
-----
* Add documentation.
* Add tests.
* Add continuous integration using github actions.
* Add functions for storing to and loading from netcdf.
* Add description of the data format.
* Add function which ensures that a dataset is in this data format.
* Provide all functions using a pint extension accessor.

0.1.0
-----

* First development release.
