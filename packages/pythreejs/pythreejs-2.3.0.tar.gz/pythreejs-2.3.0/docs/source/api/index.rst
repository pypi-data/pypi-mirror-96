API Reference
=============

The pythreejs API attempts to mimic `the three.js API`_ as closely as possible.
This API reference therefore does not attempt to explain the purpose of any
forwarded objects or attributes, but can  still be useful for:

- The trait signatures of various properties.
- Classes, properties and methods custom to pythreejs.
- Variations from the three.js API, e.g. for :py:class:`~pythreejs.BufferAttribute`.
