Description: # PyMIC: A Pytorch-Based Toolkit for Medical Image Computing
        
        This repository proivdes a library and some examples of using pytorch for medical image computing. The toolkit is under development. Currently it supports 2D and 3D image segmentation. It was originally developped for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation from CT images. If you use this toolkit, please cite the following paper:

        # Requirement
        * [Pytorch][torch_link] version >=1.0.1
        * [TensorboardX][tbx_link] to visualize training performance
        * Some common python packages such as Numpy, Pandas, SimpleITK

        # Advantages
        This package provides some basic modules for medical image computing that can be share by different applications. We currently provide the following functions:
        * Easy-to-use I/O interface to read and write different 2D and 3D images.
        * Re-userable training and testing pipeline that can be transfered to different tasks.
        * Various data pre-processing methods before sending a tensor into a network.
        * Implementation of loss functions (for image segmentation).
        * Implementation of evaluation metrics to get quantitative evaluation of your methods (for segmentation). 
        
        # Usage
        Run the following command to install PyMIC:
        
        ```bash
        pip install PYMIC
        ```
        
        Go to `examples` to see some examples for using PyMIC. For beginners, you only need to simply change the configuration files to select different datasets, networks and training methods for running the code (example 1 - 3). For advanced users, you can develop your own modules based on this package (example 4). You can find the following examples:
        
        1, `examples\JSRT`: use a predefined 2D U-Net for heart segmentation from X-ray images.
        
        2, `examples\fetal_hc`: use a predefined 2D U-Net for fetal brain segmentation from ultrasound images.
        
        3, `examples\prostate`: use a predefined 3D U-Net for prostate segmentation from 3D MRI.
        
        4, `examples\JSRT2`: define your custermized network and loss function for heart segmentation from X-ray images.
        
        # Projects based on PyMIC
        Using PyMIC, it becomes easy to develop deep learning models for different projects, such as the following:
        
        1, [COPLE-Net][coplenet] (TMI 2020), COVID-19 Pneumonia Segmentation from CT images. 
        
        2, [Head-Neck-GTV][hn_gtv] (NeuroComputing 2020) Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) GTV segmentation from Head and Neck CT images. 
        
        3, [UGIR][ugir] (MICCAI 2020) Uncertainty-guided interactive refinement for medical image segmentation.
