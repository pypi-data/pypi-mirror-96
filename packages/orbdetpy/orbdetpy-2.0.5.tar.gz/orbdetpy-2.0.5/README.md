orbdetpy is a Python library for orbit determination. It is a thin
Python wrapper for our Java estimation tools and Orekit <http://www.orekit.org/>.

Features
--------

Dynamics in orbdetpy can be configured with:

1. EGM96 gravity field up to degree and order 360.
2. Earth solid tides due to the influence of the Sun and Moon.
3. FES 2004 ocean tide model up to degree and order 100.
4. NRL MSISE-00 and exponential atmospheric drag models.
5. Solar radiation pressure.
6. Third body perturbations from the Sun and Moon.
7. Satellite box-wing models and maneuvers.

Range, range-rate, angles, and inertial state measurements are supported.
Filtering can be done with our Unscented Kalman Filter or Orekit's Extended
Kalman Filter. Dynamic Model Compensation (DMC) can be used with either
filter to estimate unmodeled accelerations.

Installation
------------

1. Install Java SE 11 (11.0.10) from <https://www.oracle.com/javadownload>.
   Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the Java installation
   folder. The `java` executable must be added to the system path.

2. Install Python 3.8.0 or higher and run `pip install orbdetpy` to install
   orbdetpy and other package dependencies.

3. Update the astrodynamics data under `orbdetpy/orekit-data` periodically by
   running the following. You will need `root` privileges on some systems.

   `python -c "from orbdetpy.astro_data import update_data; update_data();"`

Development
-----------

1. Download and extract <https://github.com/ut-astria/orbdetpy/releases/download/2.0.5/orekit-data.tar.gz>
   under the `orbdetpy/` sub-folder.

2. Developers will need Apache Maven 3+ to build the Java library. Build
   using the following from the `orbdetpy/` sub-folder, where `os_cpu_type` is
   `linux-x86_64`, `linux-x86_32`, `windows-x86_64`, `windows-x86_32`,
   `osx-x86_64`, or `osx-x86_32` depending on your CPU and OS:

   `mvn -e -Dos.detected.classifier=os_cpu_type package`

   The command-line is simpler on Intel/AMD 64-bit Linux:

   `mvn -e package`

Examples
--------

1. `fit_radec.py` : Run OD with real angles measurements. Also demonstrates
   the Laplace IOD method for estimating an initial state vector.

2. `interpolate_oem.py` : Command-line tool for interpolating state vectors
   from CCSDS OEM ephemeris files. OEM files are available for download at
   <http://astria.tacc.utexas.edu/AstriaGraph>.

3. `predict_passes.py` : Predict satellite passes for ground stations or
   geographic regions using TLEs. Current elements may be obtained from
   sites such as <http://www.celestrak.com>.

4. `propagate_tle.py` : Propagate TLEs given by command-line arguments.

5. `test_conversion.py` : Test reference frame and other conversion functions.

6. `test_estimation.py` : Demonstrates measurement simulation and orbit
   determination functions.

7. `test_interpolation.py` : Interpolate state vectors.

Known Issues
------------

1. You might receive warnings from the Windows Defender Firewall on Microsoft
   Windows. Grant `orbdetpy` network access permissions.

2. If you use the `multiprocessing` Python package, imports and calls into
   `orbdetpy` must not span `multiprocessing` function calls. That is, `orbdetpy`
   can be used in the parent process or the spawned child processes, but not both.
   A workaround is to run the `orbdetpy` RPC server using `orbdetpy/start_server.sh`
   in a separate terminal window before running your Python code.
