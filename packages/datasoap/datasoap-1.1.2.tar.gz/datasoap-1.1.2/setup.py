The module checks cell data for correct numerical formatting and converts mismatched data to the correct data type (ex. str > float64).\n\n## Main Features\n\n- Strips unnecessary characters from numerical data fields in pandas dataframes to ensure consistent data formatting\n- Provides before and after representations of dataframes to allow for comparison\n\n## Repository\n\nSource code is hosted on: [github.com/snake-fingers/data-soap](https://github.com/Snake-Fingers/datasoap)\n\n## Dependencies\n\npandas - Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\npoetry add datasoap\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nUser Docs can be found at [datasoap docs](https://datasoap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## Background\n\ndatasoap originated from a Code Fellows 401 Python midterm project. The project team includes Alex Angelico, Grace Choi, Robert Carter, Mason Fryberger, and Jae Choi. After working with a few painful datasets using, we wanted to create a library that allows users to more efficiently manipulate clean datasets extracted from CSVs that may have inconsistent formatting.\n\n## Future Features in Planning\n- Additional functionality that re-names columns with the common unit of measure.\n- Automation of identifying columns that require reformatting, removing the need for user input on instantiation\n- Extend useablity to work with other virtual environments such as pip, and conda',
