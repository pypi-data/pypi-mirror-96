LOGREAD_USAGE = """\
Print a log in human readable format.

There are two ways to use this command, either:
    catsoop logread FILE

    FILE: a file on disk representing a CAT-SOOP log


or:
    catsoop logread USERNAME PATH LOGNAME

    USERNAME: the name of the user
    PATH: a path from the root, separated by slashes, including the course
          name, e.g. spring19/labs/lab01
    LOGNAME: the name of the log to read (likely either problemstate or
             problemactions)
"""

LOGWRITE_USAGE = """\
Overwrite the given log with the contents of a file.  This operation is
unconditional; not a good idea unless you're sure you want to do it!


There are two ways to use this command, either:
    catsoop logwrite LOGFILE ENTRYFILE

    LOGFILE: a file on disk representing a binary CAT-SOOP log
    ENTRYFILE: a file on disk containing a log in human-readable form, or - to
               read the entry from stdin


or:
    catsoop logread USERNAME PATH LOGNAME ENTRYFILE

    USERNAME: the name of the user
    PATH: a path from the root, separated by slashes, including the course
          name, e.g. spring19/labs/lab01
    LOGNAME: the name of the log to read (likely either problemstate or
             problemactions)
    ENTRYFILE: a file on disk containing a log in human-readable form, or - to
               read the entry from stdin
"""

LOGEDIT_USAGE = """\
Open a log entry for editing in a human readable format.  Changes made
to the file will be written back to the log.  If $EDITOR is set, it will
be used.  Otherwise, we'll try a sensible default (vim, emacs, or nano).
This is a small wrapper around logread and logwrite.

There are two ways to use this command, either:
    catsoop logedit FILE

    FILE: a file on disk representing a CAT-SOOP log


or:
    catsoop logedit USERNAME PATH LOGNAME

    USERNAME: the name of the user
    PATH: a path from the root, separated by slashes, including the course
          name, e.g. spring19/labs/lab01
    LOGNAME: the name of the log to read (likely either problemstate or
             problemactions)
