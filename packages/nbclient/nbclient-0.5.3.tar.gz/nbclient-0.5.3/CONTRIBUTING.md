# Contributing

We follow the
[Jupyter Contribution Workflow](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor/content-contributor.html)
and the [IPython Contributing Guide](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Testing

In your environment `pip install -e '.[test]'` will be needed to be able to
run all of the tests.

# Documentation

NbClient needs some PRs to copy over documentation!

# Releasing

If you are going to release a version of `nbclient` you should also be capable
of testing it and building the docs.

Please follow the instructions in [Testing](#testing) and [Documentation](#documentation) if
you are unfamiliar with how to do so.

The rest of the release process can be found in [these release instructions](./RELEASING.md).
