Description: Faraday introduces a new concept - IPE (Integrated Penetration-Test Environment) a multiuser Penetration test IDE. Designed for distributing, indexing, and analyzing the data generated during a security audit.
        
        Made for true pentesters!
        
        Faraday was made to let you take advantage of the available tools in the community in a truly multiuser way.
        
        Designed for simplicity, users should notice no difference between their own terminal application and the one included in Faraday. Developed with a specialized set of functionalities, users improve their own work. Do you remember the last time you programmed without an IDE? What IDEs are to programming, Faraday is to pentesting.
