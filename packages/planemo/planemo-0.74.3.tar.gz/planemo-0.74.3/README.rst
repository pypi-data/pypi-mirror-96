Quick Start
-----------

-----------------
Obtaining
-----------------

For a traditional Python installation of Planemo, first set up a virtualenv
for ``planemo`` (this example creates a new one in ``.venv``) and then
install with ``pip``. Planemo requires pip 7.0 or newer.

::

    $ virtualenv .venv; . .venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install "pip>=7" # Upgrade pip if needed.
    $ pip install planemo

For information on updating Planemo, installing the latest development release,
or installing Planemo via `Bioconda <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes>`__
- checkout the `installation <http://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`__
documentation.

Planemo is also available as a `virtual appliance
<https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appliance.html>`_ bundled
with a preconfigured Galaxy server and set up for Galaxy_ and
`Common Workflow Language`_ tool development.
You can choose from open virtualization format (OVA_, .ova) or Docker_
appliances.

-----------------
Basics - Galaxy
-----------------

This quick start will assume you have a directory with one or more Galaxy
tool XML files. If no such directory is available, one can be quickly created for
demonstrating ``planemo`` as follows ``project_init --template=demo mytools; cd mytools``.

Planemo can check tool XML files for common problems and best
practices using the ``lint`` `command <http://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/commands.html#lint-command>`_
(also aliased as ``l``).

::

    $ planemo lint

Like many ``planemo`` commands - by default this will search the
current directory and use all tool files it finds. It can be explicitly
passed a path to tool files or a directory of tool files.

::

    $ planemo l randomlines.xml

The ``lint`` command takes in additional options related to
reporting levels, exit code, etc. These options are described
in the `docs <http://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/commands.html#lint-command>`_
or (like with all commands) can be accessed by passing ``--help`` to it.

::

    $ planemo l --help
    Usage: planemo lint [OPTIONS] TOOL_PATH

Once tools are syntactically correct - it is time to test. The ``test``
`command <http://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/commands.html#test-command>`__
can be used to test a tool or a directory of tools.

::

	$ planemo test --galaxy_root=../galaxy randomlines.xml

If no ``--galaxy_root`` is defined, Planemo will download and configure
a disposable Galaxy instance for testing.

Planemo will create a HTML output report in the current directory named
``tool_test_output.html`` (override with ``--test_output``). See an
`example <http://galaxyproject.github.io/planemo/tool_test_viewer.html?test_data_url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jmchilton/9d4351c9545d34209904/raw/9ed285d3cf98e435fc4a743320363275949ad63c/index>`_
of such a report for Tophat.

Once tools have been linted and tested - the tools can be viewed in a
Galaxy interface using the ``serve`` (``s``) `command
<http://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/commands.html#serve-command>`__.

::

	$ planemo serve

Like ``test``, ``serve`` requires a Galaxy root and one can be
explicitly specified with ``--galaxy_root`` or installed dynamically
with ``--install_galaxy``.

For more information on building Galaxy tools in general please check out
`Building Galaxy Tools Using Planemo`_.

For more information on developing Galaxy workflows with Planemo checkout
`best practices for Galaxy Workflows`_ and the description of Planemo's
`test format`_. For information on developing Galaxy training materials
checkout the `contributing documentation <https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/>`__
on training.galaxyproject.org.

----------------------------------
Basics - Common Workflow Language
----------------------------------

This quick start will assume you have a directory with one or more `Common Workflow
Language`_ YAML files. If no such directory is available, one can be quickly created for
demonstrating ``planemo`` as follows ``planemo project_init --template=seqtk_complete_cwl mytools; cd mytools``.

Planemo can check tools YAML files for common problems and best
practices using the ``lint`` `command <http://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/commands.html#lint-command>`_
(also aliased as ``l``).

::

    $ planemo lint

Like many ``planemo`` commands - by default this will search the
current directory and use all tool files it finds. It can be explicitly
passed a path to tool files or a directory of tool files.

::

    $ planemo l seqtk_seq.cwl

The ``lint`` command takes in additional options related to
reporting levels, exit code, etc. These options are described
in the `docs <http://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/commands.html#lint-command>`_
or (like with all commands) can be accessed by passing ``--help`` to it.

::

    $ planemo l --help
    Usage: planemo lint [OPTIONS] TOOL_PATH

Once tools are syntactically correct - it is time to test. The ``test``
`command <http://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/commands.html#test-command>`__
can be used to test a CWL tool, workflow, or a directories thereof.

::

  $ planemo test --engine cwltool seqtk_seq.cwl

Planemo will create a HTML output report in the current directory named
``tool_test_output.html``. Check out the file ``seqtk_seq_tests.yml`` for
an example of Planemo test for a CWL tool. A test consists of any number of
jobs (with input descriptions) and corresponding output assertions.

Checkout the `Commmon Workflow User Guide`_ for more information on developing
CWL tools in general and  `Building Common Workflow Language Tools`_ for more
information on using Planemo to develop CWL tools.

---------
Tool Shed
---------

Planemo can help you publish tools to the Galaxy Tool Shed.
Check out `Publishing to the Tool Shed`_ for more information.

------
Conda
------

Planemo can help develop tools and Conda packages in unison.
Check out the `Galaxy <http://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_advanced.html#dependencies-and-conda>`__ or `CWL
<http://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_advanced_cwl.html#dependencies-and-conda-cwl>`__ version of the "Dependencies and Conda" tutorial
for more information.

-----------------------
Docker and Containers
-----------------------

Planemo can help develop tools that run in "Best Practice" containers for
scientific workflows. Check out the `Galaxy <http://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_advanced.html#dependencies-and-containers>`__ or `CWL
<http://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_advanced_cwl.html#dependencies-and-containers-cwl>`__ version of the "Dependencies and Containers" tutorial for more information.
