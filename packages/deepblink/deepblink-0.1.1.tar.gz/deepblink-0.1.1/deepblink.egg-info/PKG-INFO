Description: In biomedical microscopy data, a common task involves the detection of diffraction-limited spots that
        visualize single proteins, domains, mRNAs, and many more. These spots were traditionally detected with
        mathematical operators such as Laplacian of Gaussian. These operators, however, rely on human input ranging
        from image-intensity thresholds, approximative spot sizes, etc. This process is tedious and not always
        reliable.
        
        DeepBlink relies on neural networks to automatically find spots without the need for human
        intervention. DeepBlink is available as a ready-to-use command-line interface.
