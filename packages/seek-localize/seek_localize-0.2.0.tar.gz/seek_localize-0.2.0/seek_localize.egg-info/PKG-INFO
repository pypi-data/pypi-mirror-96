        seek_localize helps localize iEEG electrodes on MRI/CT images and
        deals with data processing for iEEG-BIDS data.

        -------------
        The documentation can be found under the following links:
        
        - for the `stable release <https://seek_localize.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_
        - for the `latest (development) version <https://seek_localize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_

        Setup and Installation
        ----------------------
        
        See `INSTALLATION GUIDE <https://github.com/adam2392/seek_localize/blob/master/doc/installation.rst>`_ for full instructions.
        A quick setup can occur with github and ``pipenv``. This has been tested on
        Python versions 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            # clone repository locally
            $ git clone https://github.com/adam2392/seek_localize
            $ python3.8 -m venv .venv
            $ pipenv install
        
        Through pip
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install seek_localize
        
        Quick Usage
        -----------
        Here is a quick look at a basic use-case, where we want to label the anatomical regions each
        electrode is in, based on FreeSurfer.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from seek_localize import label_elecs_anat
            from mne_bids import BIDSPath
        
            # define file path to the T1w image that electrode coordinates are localized in
            img_fname = ...
        
            # define a path to the electrodes.tsv file in iEEG-BIDS
            bids_path = BIDSPath(..., suffix='electrodes', extension='.tsv')
        
            # define filepath to the FreeSurferColor Look up Table
            # (it is stored locally)
            fs_lut_fpath = seek_localize.fs_lut_fpath
        
            label_elecs_anat(bids_path, img_fname, fs_lut_fpath)
        
        
        Data Organization
        -----------------
        
        We use BIDS. See https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/wiki/The-BIDS-folder-hierarchy
        for more information. We recommend the following BIDS structure with the minimally required set of files.
        
        .. code-block::
        
           {bids_root}/
                /sub-001/
                    /anat/
                        - sub-001_*_T1w.nii
                    /ct/
                        - sub-001_*_CT.nii
                    /ieeg/
                        - sub-001_*_channels.tsv
                        - sub-001_*_electrodes.tsv
                        - *

        FAQ
        ===
        1. For ECoG data, we do not explicitly have a process outlined, but these are significantly easier since grids can
        be easily interpolated. See `Fieldtrip Toolbox`_.
