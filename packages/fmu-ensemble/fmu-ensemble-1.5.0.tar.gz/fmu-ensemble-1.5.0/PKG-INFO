        ==============================
        Introduction to *fmu.ensemble*
        ==============================
        
        FMU Ensemble is a Python module for handling simulation ensembles
        originating from an FMU (Fast Model Update) workflow.
        
        For documentation, see the
        `github pages for this repository <https://equinor.github.io/fmu-ensemble/>`_.
        
        Ensembles consist of realizations. Realizations consist of (input and)
        output from their associated *jobs* stored in text or binary files.
        Selected file formats (text and binary) are supported.
        
        This module will help you handle ensembles and realizations (and their
        associated data) as Python objects, and thereby facilitating the use
        use of other Python visualizations modules like webviz, plotly or
        interactive usage in IPython/Jupyter.
        
        If run as a post-workflow in Ert, a simple script using this library
        can replace and extend the existing *CSV_EXPORT1* workflow

        ----------
        
        The fmu.ensemble Python module development was started in August 2018,
        as an Equinor internal code project, building prior internal
        work from at leastL:
        
        * Smørbukk Sør webportal
        * Post-processing library made for webportal (2017/2018) https://github.com/Statoil/fmu_postprocessing
        * PyPostFMU https://git.equinor.com/FDIL/pypostfmu
