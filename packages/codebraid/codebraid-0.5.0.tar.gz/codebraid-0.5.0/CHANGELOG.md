# Change Log

## v0.5.0 (2021-02-28)

* The built-in code execution system now uses PATH to locate executables under
  Windows.  Previously PATH was ignored under Windows due to the
  implementation details of Python's `subprocess.Popen()` (#41).
* Added support for Pandoc command-line options `-C` and `--citeproc` (#42).
* `rich_output` formats with a `text/*` mime type can now be displayed `raw`,
  `verbatim`, or `verbatim_or_empty`.  For example,
  `show=rich_output:latex:raw` and `show=rich_output:latex:verbatim`.
* When a code chunk produces multiple outputs, it is now impossible for these
  to accidentally merge into a single output that does not represent the
  intended Markdown.  Raw output no longer merges with adjacent output.
  Adjacent inline code outputs no longer merge into a single, potentially
  invalid, code output.
* Most example documents now come with both HTML and Markdown output.  This is
  convenient for seeing how a Markdown-to-Markdown conversion process works.
  It also significantly simplifies Codebraid testing for new releases, which
  uses the example documents.  The HTML output changes whenever Pandoc updates
  its HTML templates.  Markdown output should be much more stable.
* `codebraid` now reads from stdin (#33).
* Added preliminary support for the Python REPL (`python_repl`) via Python's
  `code` module.  Added `cb.repl` command.
* Synchronization of code with source line numbers is now simpler and more
  robust to prevent `StopIteration` errors (#36).
* Check for compatible Pandoc version now works correctly with Pandoc 2.10+.
* Added `live_output` option for the first code chunk in a session.  This
  shows code output (stdout and stderr) live in the terminal during code
  execution (#21).
* "Includes" are now skipped during internal, intermediate file
  transformations, which prevents duplicated "includes" and associated errors
  (#20).  This applies to `header-includes`, `include-before`,
  `include-after`, `--include-in-header`, `--include-before-body`, and
  `--include-after-body`.  Roundtrip conversion from Pandoc Markdown to Pandoc
  Markdown now skips all "includes" and also ignores `toc`/`table-of-contents`
  and `--toc`/`--table-of-contents`.  This allows Codebraid to be used as a
  preprocessor and saves YAML metadata settings for a subsequent conversion
  from Pandoc Markdown to another format.
* Added option `jupyter_timeout` for the first code chunk in a session (#30).
* Fixed Pandoc 2.8+ compatibility by using `-raw_attribute` in intermediate
  Markdown.  Code output in raw format (interpreted as Markdown) is no longer
  lost when converting to document formats other than Markdown (#26).
* Added support for SageMath (#5).
* All document transformations now use `--preserve-tabs`, so code indentation
  is maintained without change and tabs no longer cause errors in syncing code
  to input line numbers (#18).
* Added support for remaining unsupported Pandoc command-line options,
  including `--defaults` (#14).
* Julia now uses `--project=@.` (#10).
* Documentation now includes details of code execution and how this can result
  in different output compared to interactive sessions (#11).
* AST walking code no longer assumes that all dict nodes represent types and
  have a "t" (type) key.  Dict nodes without a "t" key are now skipped.  This
  fixes a bug with citations of the form `[@cite]` (#12).


## v0.4.0 (2019-07-10)

* Added support for Jupyter kernels with the `jupyter_kernel` option, which
  can be used with the first code chunk in a session to specify a kernel.
  Multiple Jupyter kernels can be used within a single document, and multiple
  sessions are possible per kernel.  Added associated `rich_output` display
  options.  Rich output such as plots is displayed automatically.

* A single cache location can now be shared by multiple documents.  When
  multiple documents are built in a single directory with the default cache
  settings, they no longer remove each other's cached output.

* Inline `cb.nb` is no longer the same as `cb.expr`.  Inline `cb.nb` now shows
  output verbatim when used with Codebraid's built-in code execution system,
  and shows rich output or a verbatim text representation when used with
  Jupyter kernels.  This makes inline and block `cb.nb` behavior more
  parallel.

* Added `executable` option, which can be used with the first code chunk in a
  session.  This overrides the default executable called by the built-in code
  execution system.

* Added `include_file` and associated options.  This allows code from an
  external file to be included for execution and/or display.

* Added JavaScript support.

* Pandoc options like `--syntax-definition` can now be used multiple times.

* Fixed a bug that prevented `--webtex`, `--mathjax`, and `--katex` from
  working with Pandoc.  They now work when a URL is not specified, but do not
  yet work when a URL is given.

* When a `paste` code chunk is copied, now everything is copied, not just what
  is actually displayed by the `paste` chunk.  Improved and simplified copying
  logic.

* Added `copied_markup` option for `show` and `hide`.  This is used with
  `copy` to show the Markdown source of copied code chunks.

* Added keyword argument `hide_markup_keys` for code chunks.  This allows
  specified keys in code chunk attributes to be hidden in the Markdown source
  displayed with `markup` and `copied_markup`.

* Code chunk options `line_anchors` and `line_numbers` are now properly
  converted to boolean values.

* Improved option processing.


## v0.3.0 (2019-05-19)

* Added Bash support.

* Added `cb.code` command that simply displays code and executes nothing.

* Added `cb.paste` command that allows code and/or output to be copied from
  other code chunks.

* Added `markup` option for `show` and `hide`.  This displays the Markdown
  source for inline code or a code block.

* Added support for naming code chunks with the `name` keyword.  Added support
  for copying named code chunks into other code chunks with the `copy`
  keyword.

* Runtime source errors (code is improperly divided into code chunks, such as
  `complete=true` when it is not) are now handled like any other source
  errors, rather than as a special instance of stderr.  As part of this, the
  errors now have their own entry in the cache.

* `FileNotFoundError` for subprocesses now returns `FailedProcess` with
  correct attribute values.

* Fixed compatibility with languages that do not define an inline expression
  formatter.

* Fixed stderr syncing bug for languages that have multiple line number
  patterns.

* Fixed compatibility with Pandoc commands in which output format is inferred
  from output file name.  Better output when `codebraid` is run with no
  arguments (#3).

* Code that interferes with Codebraid's templates is now detected and results
  in error messages.

* Session names are now restricted to identifier-style strings.

* In language definitions, field `tempsuffix` is renamed to `temp_suffix`.

* Raw output from code blocks no longer merges with a following paragraph or
  other block.

* Improved newline handling.  All text is processed in universal newlines
  mode. Only `\n` is treated as a newline for line splitting.  This avoids
  edge cases from `str.splitlines()`.

* `outside_main` is now properly checked for compatibility with other options.

* More efficient AST processing.



## v0.2.0 (2019-02-25)

* Added Julia, Rust, and R support.

* Added boolean keyword argument `complete` for code chunks.  This allows code
  chunks that contain incomplete units of code, such as part of a function
  definition or part of a loop.  Any stdout from a chunk with `complete=false`
  will appear with the next chunk with `complete=true` (the default value).

* Session hashes are now more robust by including session names and chunk
  `complete` status.  This prevents the collision of sessions with identical
  code but different processing for code output.

* Added boolean keyword argument `example` for code chunks.  This displays the
  Markdown source along with the output, putting both inside a single div with
  class `example` and putting them individually in divs with classes
  `exampleMarkup` and `exampleOutput`, respectively.

* Added boolean keyword argument `outside_main` for code chunks.  Code chunks
  with `outside_main=true` at the beginning of a session will overwrite the
  beginning of the Codebraid source template, while code chunks with
  `outside_main=true` at the end of a session will overwrite the end of the
  source template.  This is primarily for compiled languages like Rust, so
  that the implicit `main()` function defined in the default source template
  can be overwritten.

* In language definitions, `source_start` and `source_end` are now combined
  into a single `source_template`.  Delimiter fields are renamed to
  `stdout_delim` and `stderr_delim` (added underscore to parallel future,
  optional delimiters).

* There is no longer any attempt to sync `RawInline` HTML precisely with the
  document source, since this can fail in some cases with HTML comments.
  `RawBlock` HTML was already not synced precisely due to similar issues.

* More robust stdout and stderr parsing.



## v0.1.0 (2019-02-15)

* Initial release.
