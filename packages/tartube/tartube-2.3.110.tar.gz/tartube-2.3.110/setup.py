long_description="""
Tartube is a GUI front-end for youtube-dl, yt-dlp and other compatible video 
downloaders.

It is partly based on youtube-dl-gui and is written in Python 3 / Gtk 3.
Tartube runs on MS Windows, Linux, BSD and MacOS.

- You can fetch a list of videos from your favourite channels and playlists on
YouTube, BitChute, and hundreds of other websites
- In buffering is an issue, you can download a temporary copy of a video before
automatically opening it in your favourite media player
- Tartube will organise your videos into convenient folders (if that's what you
want)
- Tartube can alert you when livestreams and debut videos are starting (YouTube
only)
- If creators upload their videos to more than one website (YouTube and
BitChute, for example), Tartube can interact with both sites without creating
duplicates
- Certain websites operate an "only one opinion allowed" policy. If you think
that the censors will remove a video, against the wishes of its creators and
before you've had a chance to watch it, Tartube can make an archive copy
- Certain websites frequently place restrictions on a video, not because it is
unsuitable for some audiences, but for purely political reasons. Tartube can,
in some circumstances, see videos that are region-blocked and/or age-restricted
- Certain websites manipulate search results, repeatedly unsubscribe people
from their favourite channels and/or deliberately conceal videos that they
don't like. Tartube won't do any of those things
- If you want to listen to your favourite discussion videos, for example while
driving a car, Tartube can make an archive copy of just the audio, rather than
the full video
- Tartube is free and open-source software

Note for PyPI users: Tartube should be installed with: pip3 install tartube
