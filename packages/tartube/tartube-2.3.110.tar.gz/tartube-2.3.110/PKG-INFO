Description: 
        Tartube is a GUI front-end for youtube-dl, yt-dlp and other compatible video 
        downloaders.
        
        It is partly based on youtube-dl-gui and is written in Python 3 / Gtk 3.
        Tartube runs on MS Windows, Linux, BSD and MacOS.
        
        - You can fetch a list of videos from your favourite channels and playlists on
        YouTube, BitChute, and hundreds of other websites
        - In buffering is an issue, you can download a temporary copy of a video before
        automatically opening it in your favourite media player
        - Tartube will organise your videos into convenient folders (if that's what you
        want)
        - Tartube can alert you when livestreams and debut videos are starting (YouTube
        only)
        - If creators upload their videos to more than one website (YouTube and
        BitChute, for example), Tartube can interact with both sites without creating
        duplicates
        - Certain websites operate an "only one opinion allowed" policy. If you think
        that the censors will remove a video, against the wishes of its creators and
        before you've had a chance to watch it, Tartube can make an archive copy
        - Certain websites frequently place restrictions on a video, not because it is
        unsuitable for some audiences, but for purely political reasons. Tartube can,
        in some circumstances, see videos that are region-blocked and/or age-restricted
        - Certain websites manipulate search results, repeatedly unsubscribe people
        from their favourite channels and/or deliberately conceal videos that they
        don't like. Tartube won't do any of those things
        - If you want to listen to your favourite discussion videos, for example while
        driving a car, Tartube can make an archive copy of just the audio, rather than
        the full video
        - Tartube is free and open-source software
        
        Note for PyPI users: Tartube should be installed with: pip3 install tartube
