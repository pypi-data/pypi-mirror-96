Description: # s2-py
        
        A setuptools wrapper around the [s2geometry library](https://github.com/google/s2geometry).
        
        ### Requirements
        The libs from s2geometry are still required. See [here](https://github.com/google/s2geometry/master/README.md)
        
        Note that currently it seems that the Google test framework is [mistakenly not optional](https://github.com/google/s2geometry/issues/67).
        
        ### Notes
        All credit goes to Google; this is just a wrapper around their lib.
