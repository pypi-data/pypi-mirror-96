# The yaml config consists of three sections, minerals, fluids and dryrock.
# Elastic values for dry rock, having the mineral as its pore-material and
# saturated with the fluid is outputed. The tutorial consists of three
# cases corresponding to the three rows in the data file.
#
# The tutorial can be executed as follows:
# open_petro_elastic --data-file tutorial_data.csv tutorial_config.yaml

# The minerals in this tutorial consists of sand and shale. The volume-fraction
# of sand is found in the data file. Since shale fraction is left out , it is
# assigned the remainder of volume.
minerals:
    constituents:
        - material: # sand

            density: 2650.0 # kg/m3
            # fraction is found in csv file, column "sand_fraction"
          fraction:

            density: 1.0 # kg/m3
            # fraction of shale is 1 - sum(other materials)

# As with minerals, fluids is mainly just the list of constituents,
# but temperature can be given which is used for the
# modeling of oil, brine, gas and condensate. Oil, brine, gas
# and condensate are given pressure from pressure->fluid.
fluids:
    temperature: 75.0 # celsius
    constituents:
        - material:
            type: "oil"
            gas_gravity: 0.5 # ratio to air (air gas gravity is 1)

        - material:
            type: "brine"
            salinity: 45000 # ppm
          fraction: # Ratio of brine to remaining fluid
            column: "brine_saturation"

# The pressure section describes the various pressures
# the rock is affected by.
pressure:
    #Overburden pressure is the pressure on the rock from the weight
    #of the rock and earth above the formation.
    overburden: 50.0E+6 # Pa
    # The reference pressure is the pore pressure at reference
    # conditions, used for pressure dependency calculation.
    reference: 30.0E+6 # Pa
    # Fluid pressure is the pore pressure applied to the fluid.
    fluid: 40.0E+6
    # Rock pressure is the pore pressure applied to the rock.
    # This is optional and defaults to fluid pressure.
    rock: 42.0E+6
    # max_effective is a truncation value for effective pressure.
    max_effective: 100.0E+6 # Pa

# The dry_rock section describes the porous dry rock of the dense mineral.
# The different models have several additional keys for tweaking the model.
# Additionally pressure dependency and depth trend adjustments can be added,
# see github.com/equinor/open_petro_elastic for more information.

    model:
        # patchy cement is a hybrid model which is a combination of friable sand and
        # contact cement. The properties of the hybrid model is on the line between
        # two points, friable sand on one end and contact cement on the other end.
        # The weights are calculated using a lower bound (friable sand with lower bound
        # on pressure) and an upper bound (constant cement with upper bound porosity)
        # Then the weight for e.g. bulk modulus is calculated as follows:
        # w_bulk = (cc_bulk - lower_bulk) / (upper_bulk - lower_bulk)
        # where cc_bulk is the bulk modulus of constant cement, upper_bulk is the bulk
        # modulus of the upper bound, and lower_bulk is the bulk modulus of the lower bound.
