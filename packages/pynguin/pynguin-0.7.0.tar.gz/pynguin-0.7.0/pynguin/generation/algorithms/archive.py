    The archive is used to store the shortest covering test cases found so far.  It
    also keeps track of which targets are yet to cover.

    For each objective of MOSA, the archive stores the chromosome which covers that
    objective.  Furthermore, when two chromosomes cover the same objective,
    the archive retains the smaller of the two, thus automatically optimising for the
    test case length as secondary criterion.

    It is imperative to know the best possible fitness value for a given fitness
    function.  Otherwise, the archive cannot determine whether or not the target has
    been reached.  Therefore, we limit ourselves to minimising fitness functions and
    assume 0.0 the best possible value.  This does not restrict generality as it is
    trivial to convert from maximising to minimising fitness functions.
