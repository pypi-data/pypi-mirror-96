Description: Getting started
        ===============
        
        AWS simple pipeline package is implemented for deploying a Continuous Deployment or Delivery system (CD) by AWS CodePipeline service.
        
        You can use this simple pipeline for deploying your personal solution in 2 environments: staging and production.
        
        It is part of the `educational repositories <https://github.com/pandle/materials>`_ to learn how to write stardard code and common uses of the TDD, CI and CD.
        
        Prerequisites
        #############
        
        You have to install the `AWS Cloud Development Kit <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/>`_ (AWS CDK) for deploying the AWS simple pipeline:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            npm install -g aws-cdk # for installing AWS CDK
            cdk --help # for printing its commands
        
        And you need an AWS account, in this repository called **your-account**.
        
        Installation
        ############
        
        The package is not self-consistent. So you have to download the package by github and to install the requirements before to deploy on AWS:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/bilardi/aws-simple-pipeline
            cd aws-simple-pipeline/
            pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
            export AWS_PROFILE=your-account
            cdk deploy
        
        Or if you want to use this package into your code, you can install by python3-pip:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip3 install aws_simple_pipeline
            python3
            >>> import aws_simple_pipeline
            >>> help(aws_simple_pipeline)
