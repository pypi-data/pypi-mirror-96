Description: Getting started
        ===============
        
        AWS static website package is implemented for deploying a bucket with its Cloudfront distribution and its domain name.
        
        You can use this package for deploying a static website on the bucket deployed.
        
        It is part of the `educational repositories <https://github.com/pandle/materials>`_ to learn how to write stardard code and common uses of the TDD.
        
        Prerequisites
        #############
        
        You have to install the `AWS Cloud Development Kit <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/>`_ (AWS CDK) for deploying the AWS resources:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            npm install -g aws-cdk # for installing AWS CDK
            cdk --help # for printing its commands
        
        And you need an AWS account, in this repository called **your-account**.
        
        Installation
        ############
        
        The package is not self-consistent. So you have to download the package by github and to install the requirements before to deploy on AWS:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/bilardi/aws-static-website
            cd aws-static-website/
            pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
            export AWS_PROFILE=your-account
            cdk deploy
        
        Or if you want to use this package into your code, you can install by python3-pip:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip3 install aws_static_website
            python3
            >>> import aws_static_website
            >>> help(aws_static_website)
