1. INSTALLATION

1.1 REQUISITES

RADL is based on python, so Python 2.6 or higher runtime and standard library must
be installed in the system.

If you will use pip to install the IM, all the requisites will be installed.
You must install them if you will install RADL from sources.

It is also required to install the Python Lex & Yacc library (http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/).
It is available in all of the main distributions as 'python-ply' package.

1.2 INSTALLING

1.2.1 FROM PIP

You only have to call the install command of the pip tool with the RADL package.

/opt/radl or other).

	$ chown -R root:root RADL-X.XX
