Introduction
------------

This python module provides a logging infrastructure. It contains various classes to implement logging and aid in debugging.

How to use this module
----------------------





Basic Architecture
------------------

Documentation of Log Objects
----------------------------

In order to use loggers you need to know which classes there are end what kind of methods they offer for use. The next subchapters
will provide you with that information.

### Common Methods

Every log object will provide the following methods for use:

```python
#
# Perform logging with log level DEBUG.
#
# @param	string text		The text to write to this logger.
#
def debug(self, text)
```

```python
#
# Perform logging with log level NOTICE.
#
# @param	string text		The text to write to this logger.
#
def notice(self, text)
```

```python
#
# Perform logging with log level INFO.
#
# @param	string text		The text to write to this logger.
#
def info(self, text)
```

```python
#
# Perform logging with log level STDOUT.
# This method is intended to be used in conjunction with STDOUT handlers.
#
# @param	string text		The text to write to this logger.
#
def stdout(self, text)
```

```python
#
# Perform logging with log level WARNING.
#
# @param	string text		The text to write to this logger.
#
def warning(self, text)
```

```python
#
# Perform logging with log level ERROR.
#
# @param	string text		The text to write to this logger.
#
def error(self, text)
```

```python
#
# Perform logging with log level STDERR.
# This method is intended to be used in conjunction with STDERR handlers.
#
# @param	string text		The text to write to this logger.
#
def stderr(self, text)
```

```python
#
# Perform logging with log level EXCEPTION.
#
# @param	Exception exception		The exception to write to this logger.
#
def exception(self, exception)
```

```python
#
# If this logger is buffering log messages, clear all log messages from this buffer.
# If this logger has references to other loggers, such as a <c>FilterLogger</c>
# or a <c>MulticastLogger</c>
#
def clear(self)
```

Other log objects will provide additional methods.

### `BufferLogger`

Objects of type `BufferLogger` will provide the following additional methods:

```python
#
# Return a list of strings that contains the data stored in this logger.
# Standard formatting is used for output.
#
# @return		string[]		Returns an array of strings ready to be written to the console or a file.
#
def getBufferDataAsStrList(self)
```

```python
#
# Return a list of tuples that contains the data stored in this logger.
#
# @return		tuple[]		Returns an array of tuples. Each tuple will contain the following fields:
#							* int timeStamp : The time stamp since Epoch in seconds.
#							* EnumLogLevel logLevel : The log level of this log entry.
#							* string|Exception textOrException : A log message or an execption object.
#
def getBufferDataAsTupleList(self)
```

```python
#
# Return a single string that contains the data stored in this logger.
# Standard formatting is used for output.
#
# @return		string		Returns a single string ready to be written to the console or a file.
#
def getBufferDataAsStr(self)
```

```python
#
# Forward the log data stord in this logger to another logger.
#
# @param		AbstractLogger logger			Another logger that will receive the log data.
#
def forwardTo(self, logger, bClear = False)
```

Instantiation Based on Configuration Information Provided
---------------------------------------------------------

Often it is convenient for applications to provide some detailed way of specifying how data should be logged. For exactly that reason
this logging framework provides a function that is capable of creating loggers from some kind of description. Example:

```python
import jk_logging

logger = jk_logging.instantiate({
	"type": "MulticastLogger",
	"nested": [
		{
			"type": "ConsoleLogger"
		},
		{
			"type": "FileLogger",
			"filePath": "mylogfile-%Y-%m-%d.log",
			"rollOver": "day"
		}
	]
})
```

(more description comeing soon)

Examples
--------

Here is some example code that demonstrates the use of the various loggers available:

```python
print()
print("-- ConsoleLogger --")
print()

clog = ConsoleLogger.create()

clog.debug("This is a test for DEBUG.")
clog.notice("This is a test for NOTICE.")
clog.info("This is a test for INFO.")
clog.warning("This is a test for WARNING.")
clog.error("This is a test for ERROR.")

print()
print("-- Exception Handling --")
print()

def produceError():
	a = 5
	b = 0
	c = a / b

try:
	clog.notice("Now let's try a calculation that will fail ...")
	produceError()
except Exception as ee:
	clog.error(ee)

print()
print("-- FilterLogger --")
print()

flog = FilterLogger.create(clog, EnumLogLevel.WARNING)

flog.notice("This message will not appear in the log output.")
flog.error("This message will appear in the log output.")

print()
print("-- DetectionLogger --")
print()

dlog = DetectionLogger.create(clog)
dlog.notice("A notice.")
dlog.debug("A debug message.")
dlog.info("An informational message.")
dlog.debug("Another debug message.")
print(dlog.getLogMsgCountsStrMap())
print("Do we have debug messages? Answer: " + str(dlog.hasDebug()))
print("Do we have error messages? Answer: " + str(dlog.hasError()))

print()
print("-- BufferLogger --")
print()

blog = BufferLogger.create()
blog.info("First we write something to a buffer.")
blog.info("And something more.")
blog.notice("And more.")
blog.debug("And even more.")
blog.info("Then we write it to the console by forwarding the data to another logger.")
blog.forwardTo(clog)

print()
print("-- MulticastLogger --")
print()

mlog = MulticastLogger.create(clog, clog)
mlog.info("This message gets written twice.")

print()
print("-- NamedMulticastLogger --")
print()

nmlog = NamedMulticastLogger.create()
nmlog.addLogger("log1", clog)
nmlog.addLogger("log2", clog)
nmlog.info("This message gets written twice.")
nmlog.removeLogger("log1")
nmlog.info("This message gets written once.")
```
