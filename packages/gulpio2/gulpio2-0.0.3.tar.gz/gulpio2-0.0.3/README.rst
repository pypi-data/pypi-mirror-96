Fork notice
===========

This is a fork of TwentyBN's `gulpio <https://github.com/TwentyBN/GulpIO>`_.
Key differences:

* **faster**: Uses ``simplejpeg`` for JPEG decoding by default (a wrapper around
  libjpeg-turbo) and replaces OpenCV with Pillow-SIMD for resizing images.
* **more flexible**: More frame access patterns are supported, not only ``slice``
  accesses.


Installation
============

.. code::

    pip install "git+https://github.com/willprice/GulpIO2.git"


Prior Art
=========

* Inspired by: MXNet based RecordIO: http://mxnet.io/architecture/note_data_loading.html
* GulpIO: Original codebase https://github.com/TwentyBN/GulpIO
