**ipywidgets**, also known as jupyter-widgets or simply widgets, are
`interactive HTML widgets <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Index.ipynb>`_
for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel.

Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of
their data and can visualize changes in the data.

Learning becomes an immersive, fun experience. Researchers can easily see
how changing inputs to a model impact the results. We hope you will add
ipywidgets to your notebooks, and we're here to help you get started.
