# Dictionizr

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/dictionizr.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/dictionizr)

This project was created because I kept creating the methods `to_dict()` and `from_dict()` on many of my python classes and I knew there must be a way to adhere to the DRY principal.

### Installation
