## [0.3.0] - 2021-02-20

### Added
- Added BaseHatcher.boundaryBoundingBox() to obtain the bounding box of a collection of polygons - returned internally from PyClipper
- Added a `simplifyBoundaries()` in [hatching/utils.py](pyslm/hatching/utils.py) to simplify polygons (shapely and raw coordinate boundaries using scikit image)
-` hatching.generateExposurePoints()` now generates for `ContourGeometry`
- Added [example_exporting_multilayer.py](examples/example_exporting_multilayer.py) showing how to export a multi-layer build using libSLM - 52090085fd52336e2cc2181ff886a8aebbdca1ef
- Added [example_custom_island_hatcher.py](examples/example_custom_island_hatcher.py) showing a method to create customised island scan
- Added [example_custom_island_hatcher.py](examples/example_custom_island_hatcher.py) showing a method to create customised island scan
- Added a `HexagonIsland` Class to demonstrate custom implementation of island regions
- Added [example_build_time_analysis.py](examples/example_build_time_analysis.py) to show the processes of estimating build-time
- Added [example_custom_sinusoidal_hatching.py](examples/example_custom_sinusoidal_hatching.py) for showing custom hatch-infills - c7c1a4304dd4f2a4cdf0286385ccb68d3968ba5e
- Added a method `BaseHatcher.clipContourLines` for clipping open scan paths to fill a region
- Added an analysis method utility `getBuildStyleById` to find the `BuildStyle` given a model id and build style id
- Added a method in plotLayer to visualise the scan vector properties (e.g. length)
- Added properties for geometry class to be compatible with [libSLM](https://github.com/drlukeparry/libSLM) 0.2.2 - providing multi-laser compatibility
- Added the method `Part.getTrimeshSlice` to get a `trimesh.Path2D` slice from the geometry - bb2ebb9c4514a05cc1728c810deef7fc6c3239e4
- Added a method to find the 'inverse' projection of support faces
- Added `visualise.visualiseOverhang` for showing overhang regions
- Added `geometry.utils.ModelValidator` for validting the build inputs (layers, models) when exporting to a machine build file
- Added a `.gitignore` file - 498d9116dd9d91698695669d5d1309a7941e0dd9

### Changed
- Internally generateHatching() and hatch() in subclasses of `BaseHatcher` to generate the internal hatch geometry to use multiple boundaries
to ensure that the subregion generation sorting covers the global region. 
- Internally `BaseHatcher.boundaryBoundingBox()` is called instead of `BaseHatcher.polygonBoundingBox()`
- Removed the for loop which previously iterate across boundaries.
- Updated IslandHatcher to use this behaviour 
- Updated BaseHatcher to use static members where possible
- Analysis method `analysis.getLayerTime` requires a `Model` list
- Analysis methods use point exposure time and distance using `analysis.getLayerTime` 
- Removed debug messages when visualising layers
- Fixed import of submodules in PySLM - 66f48fd9929d244b836583f24c087602cdc31a96

### Fixed
- Fixed `LaserMode`, `LaserType` Enums to be compatible with libSLM - 52090085fd52336e2cc2181ff886a8aebbdca1ef
- Jump distance between `LayerGeometry` is accounted for in the [Analysis Submodule](pyslm/analysis)
- Updated Documentation across the project

## [0.2.1] - 2020-06-19

### Fixed
- Fixed the setup.py source tarball to include the PyClipper extensions. 

## [0.2.0] - 2020-06-17
 
Development branch of PySLM with new features. 
 
### Added
- Added transformations to the Part class so that these can be translated, rotated, scaled efficiently on demand
    - Updates on the geometry are cached when geometry method is called.
    - Method included to drop the part to the platform
- Added an enhanced version and higher performance of generated clippable island regions.
    - Introduced `InnerHatchRegion` in the hatching submodule
    - Introduce `IslandHatcher` which re-implements the Island/Checkerboard Scan Strategy
- Added a method to alternate adjacent scan vectors in the hatching module
- Added a method to `generateExposurePoint` method in the hatching submodule to create exposure points from scan vectors
- Added a Geometry Submodule in [pyslm.geometry](pyslm/geometry)
    - libSLM Python Extension Library is used if available
    - A set of native compatible Python classes are available if libSLM is not available
    - Classes include: 
        - `Layer`
        - `LayerGeometry`
        - `Model`
        - `BuildStyle`
        - `Header`
        - `HatchGeometry`, `ContourGeometry`, `PointsGeometry`
- Added an Analysis Module in [pyslm.analysis](pyslm/analysis):
    - Total length of all the scan vectors across a layer
    - Total jump length between scan vectors across all vectors  
    - Total scan time across a layer
- Added a method to generate bitmap slices from a single image is included in Part

### Changed
- `Part.getVectorSlice` method by default returns a list of coord paths
- `Part.getVectorSlice` now returns a list of `Shapely.geometry.Polygon` if optional argument is passed
- `hatching.IslandHatcher` in the previous release is changed to `BasicIslandHatcher`
 
### Fixed
- Further changes and improvements to the overall documentation. 
- Updated requirements.txt to ensure documentation can correctly build on readthedocs

## [0.1.0] - 2020-05-08
