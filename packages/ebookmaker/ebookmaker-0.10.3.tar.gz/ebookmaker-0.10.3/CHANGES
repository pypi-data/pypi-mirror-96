0.10.3 February 25, 2020
- added rendering for <q>: ebookmaker will now change all <q> tags to <span> for epub builds, keeping any attributes on the tags. curly quotes will be added inside the spans, double for top level q and single for all q nest in other qs.

0.10.2 January 18, 2020
- corrected text in PG footer for RST - thanks Roger Frank. Note that boilerplate generation is being revised for v0.11
- when reflowing pre, don't make it one long line. This was causing problems in the Kobo reader.
- don't drop a heading that starts with "by " if class 'x-ebookmaker-important' is on it.
- also log headings that are dropped because they start with "by "
- fix bug in anchor fixing where if an <a> tag had both id and name attributes, both were deleted.
- delinting

0.10.1 November 25, 2020
- fixed minor issue where "too deep" errors were emitted for self-links. Thanks to rfrank for the error report.
- fixed deprecation warning from Docutils; should be ok for Docutils > 0.1 

0.10.0 November 2, 2020
- SVG files are now considered images and included in EPUBs. They were being discarded. SVG files are not scaled or compressed by ebookmaker - the renderer should be able to auto-scale. This appears to fix kindlegen failures associated with svg images.
- fixed the rst test


0.9.7 September 14, 2020
- changed font for rst conversion. Linux Libertine was unmaintained since 2012 and no package was available for CENTOS8. We switched to the closest replacement, Libertinus https://github.com/alerque/libertinus
- added documentation about configuration for rst conversion
- the deprecated 'handheld' @media query was being used to prevent ebookmaker from stripping floats. to preserve this feature, ebookmaker no longer strips floats when the css selector contains the x-ebookmaker class. Most likely, float stripping was originally needed because html pages were designed before the advent of EPUB. Today, we can assume that if the html designer uses the x-ebookmaker class, they've considered the impact of the float on the generated EPUB.
- assorted delinting

0.9.6 September 8, 2020
- added 'x-ebookmaker' class to epub body elements. There are now 4 "x-ebookmaker" classes
    - css can now apply styles that are triggered by being a descendent of .x-ebookmaker. This addition is meant to replace the 'handheld' @media query that is deprecated in HTML 5
    - the 'x-ebookmaker-important' class on on image element tells ebookmaker not to remove the image, even in no-images builds.
    - the 'x-ebookmaker-drop' class tells ebookmaker to remove an element and its descendents from ebook builds.
    - the 'x-ebookmaker-pageno' class is applied to some span elements whose content has been stripped because they use a class that indicates they represent page numbers: pagenum pageno page pb folionum foliono
- added mayan as a language not supported by kindlegen
- typos fixed in README - thanks Joseph Koshy

0.9.5 July 6, 2020
- fixed minor issue where the spider was getting confused when iterating on WrapperParsers.

0.9.4 June 30, 2020
- handle invalid quantization table in jpeg files when using quality 'keep'
- respect rel="nofollow" attribute: this allows authors to link to an alternate version file in html without duplicating content in the EPUB file.
- set wrappers to nonlinear in spine.
- fixed bugs and ugliness in toc generation
  - when the same header level is consecutive, only one toc item is generated. (We see this used to make multiline heads or titles)
  - toc normalization made a hash of the toc. Now the toc is normalized in the epubwriter, not in the parser.
  - add display:block to standard css sheet to prevent hidden headings from breaking kindlegen
- added a configuration option to use calibre (or whatever!) for non-supported in kindleget languages.

0.9.3 June 23, 2020
- Fix reversion in 0.9.2 which caused CoverWriter in EbookConverter to fail. (It uses ImageParser to convert images from PNG to JPEG
- add a test to check this

- note that EbookMaker is no longer installable in Python 2.7 (thanks cpeel)
- clean up pipfile and gitignore pipfile.lock (thanks cpeel)

- fixed issue where compression was expanding compressed jpegs (thanks choward)
- adde EBOK flag in MOBI when using ebook-convert (thanks rfrank)

0.9.1 June 11, 2020
Minor bug fix and optimization.
- picsdir builds weren't recognizing when it was copying files to themselves
- "broken" images are now inserted when an image is missing
- title attribute in wrappers needed escaping
- build times are now reported to logs
- small optimization with preparse on image parsers

0.9.0 June 2, 2020
Image handling has changed starting with 0.9
- linked images (image files as targets of links) are now wrapped in html, fixing display in ADE.
- linked images are compressed to 1MB if possible (changed from 128K)
- inline images are compressed to 256K if possible (changed from 128K)
- all images are limited to 5000x5000 pixels (was 800 x 1280)
- PNG images are scaled to meet the image filesize targets (previously no scaling of PNG images)
- L format JPEG images (greyscale) are no longer converter to RBG (thanks rfrank)
- generated covers are now 1200 x 1800
- covers and "important" images in noimages builds are scaled to 64K (previously no scaling)

General bug fixes
- eliminated double parsing due to first pass using raw paths
- when tidy fails, the (huge) error trace is only logged once.
- generated html is no longer overwritten by empty results


0.8.12 May 5, 2020
- corrected the exception to catch for missing files

0.8.11 May 4, 2020
- It turns out that ebookmaker gets called both with bare paths and file: urls depending on ebookconverter config files. So 0.8.10 broke on the production machine, though it seemed just fine on mac and windows. So we went back to the drawing board to figure out how to support posix and windows, with or without windows mount points (not sure if that's the right term), file:/// urls and bare paths. We also figured out some issues involving spaces in paths.

0.8.10 April 30, 2020
- fixed numerous file path nits on Windows
    - kindlegen
    - figsdir
    - cover
    - pdf
- PEP8 delinted:
    - EbookMaker.py
    - ParserFactory.py
    - Spider.py
    - parsers/__init__.py
    - writers/EpubWriter.py

0.8.9 April 13, 2020
- fixed issues preventing successful deployments on Windows
- added logging for books deeper than max_depth
- improved documentation for tidy and cairo prerequisites
- try to catch  and report exceptions when tidy and cairo aren't installed
- added install-on-windows notes

0.8.8 March 6, 2020
- fixed issue preventing chunking when text file is latin-1
- fixed failure when source links to a directory
- improved parse error message

0.8.7 February 10, 2020
- fixed issue causing failed build when file encoding doesn't match plateform default
- fixed issue where cover set on command line is excluded in build.

0.8.6 February 6, 2020
- fixed issue where covers aren't set when source is txt

0.8.5 January 27, 2020
- set "huge_tree" attribute for the xml parser to keep big files from blocking a build

0.8.4 January 23, 2020

    - class = 'medium' extra '}'
    - removed '%' in noindent

0.8.3 January 21, 2020
- fixed bug exposed by setting cover with a command line argument

0.8.2 January 16, 2020
- refined embedded media error message to include referrer
- added external link warning

0.8.1 January 15, 2020
- Ebookmaker has been downloading and including in epubs embedded media from arbitrary websites, for example, images. This has caused build errors when a remote site goes away. ebookmaker has command line parameters that allow include and exclude urls that have governed document files; these same rules now apply to media files.

  In general, PG books should not embed media from other sites.

0.8.0 January 10, 2020
- support ebook-convert tool from Calibre as alternative to kindlegen

    To use calibre instead of kindlegen

    1. install calibre
    2. change MOBIGEN setting to 'ebook-convert' or the path to ebook-convert

0.7.10 January 9, 2020

- build failures on our production system suggest that the parser's output for empty style elements may be os-dependent. Parser now handles style elements with null text.
- allow the build to succeed even if a css file is missing
- allow px only in border properties. see discussion below
- fix false encoding error (complaining about "Klingon") when content file is missing

Ebookmaker has been removing any css rules that use 'px' measurements. 'px' measurements are discouraged in css styles for epub because of poor scaling when user changes font size. However fixed lengths are still useful in properties such as table borders. see discussion on DP forum:
https://www.pgdp.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=41237&p=1188773&hilit=windymilla#p1188746

0.7.9 January 6, 2020

0.7.0 September 20, 2019
