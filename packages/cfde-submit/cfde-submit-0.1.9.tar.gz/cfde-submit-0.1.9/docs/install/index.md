# Installation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 ## Prerequisites
The cfde-submit command requires Python 3 and package manager "pip". Pip is included by default with Python 3.4 and later.  For more information on installation, please refer to [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org).

## Create a Virtual Environment
To avoid potential conflicts, we recommended installing `cfde-submit` from within a Python 3 virtual environment. A virtual environment is an isolated Python installation with its own set of packages separate from what has been previously installed on your system. Additional information about virtual environments can be found at [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

The steps below will walk you through the process of creating a new virtual environment called cfde_venv.

 1. To create a new environment, run the command: `python3 -m venv cfde_venv`
 2. To start the environment, run the command: `source cfde_venv/bin/activate`
 3. You should notice the string "(cfde_venv)" prepended to your shell prompt, indicating the virtual environment is running
 4. To exit the environment, run the command `deactivate` 

## Install cfde-submit
The most recent release of `cfde-submit` can be installed via pip. While cfde_venv is active, run the command: `pip3 install cfde-submit`. This will install `cfde-submit` and all other required packages. These packages will install into your virtual environment and be added to your path. To verify the installation has succeeded, run the command `cfde-submit` to see the list of available commands.
