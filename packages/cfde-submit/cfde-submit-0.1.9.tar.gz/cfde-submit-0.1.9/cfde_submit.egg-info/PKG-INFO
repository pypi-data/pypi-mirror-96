        CFDE Submit
        ===========
        
        This is a client to interact with the Globus Automate Flows for CFDE use cases.
        Both a Python API and a CLI tool are available.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The CFDE Submission Client requires Python 3.6 or later. To check which version
        of Python you have, run `python --version`. If you have both Python 2 and
        Python 3 installed, you may need to check with `python3 --version`. If this is
        the case, you will also need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` below.
        
        Install with pip:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            pip install cfde-submit
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        This tool can ingest any of the following into DERIVA:
        
        1. A directory to be formatted into a BDBag
        2. A Git repository to be copied into a BDBag
        3. A premade BDBag directory
        4. A premade BDBag in an archive file
        
        In all cases, the data must already be in CFDE TableSchema format, or the
        ingest may fail. See instructions here (link to docs pending).
        
        
        Command line
        ----------------
        
        There are four commands available: `run`, `status`, `login`, `logout`, and `reset`.
        Use them as follows:
        
        - ``cfde-submit run DATA-PATH`` will ingest the data found at ``DATA-PATH`` into
          CFDE. You can also specify the following options:
        
          - ``--output-dir=OUTPUT_DIR`` will copy the data in ``DATA-PATH``, if it is a 
            directory, to the location you specify, which must not exist and must not
            be inside ``DATA-PATH``. The resulting BDBag will be named after the output
            directory. If not specified, the BDBag will be created in-place in
            ``DATA_PATH`` if necessary.
          - ``--delete-dir`` will trigger deletion of the ``output-dir`` after processing
            is complete. If you didn't specify ``output-dir``, this option has no effect.
          - ``--ignore-git`` will prevent the client from overwriting ``output-dir`` and ``delete-dir`` to handle Git repositories.
        
        - ``cfde-submit status`` will check the status of a Flow instance. By default,
          the last run Flow is used, but if you want to check a previous Flow you can
          provide one or both of the following options:
        
          - ``--flow-id=ID`` is the ID of the Flow itself (NOT a specific instance of the Flow).
          - ``--flow-instance-id=ID`` is the ID of the particular instance/invocation of the Flow you want to check.
        
        - ``cfde-submit login`` will start the login process. If you have tokens saved
          from a previous login, this command will validate those tokens and only
          re-authenticate you if they are expired. It is not necessary to run this
          command before ``run`` or ``status``, because those commands will also
          authenticate you if needed.
        
        - ``cfde-submit logout`` will log you out and revoke any valid cached tokens.
        
        - ``cfde-submit reset`` will reset your cfde-submit configuration.
        
        Python API
        ----------
        
        The ``CfdeClient`` class, once instantiated, has the following methods:
        
        - ``start_deriva_flow(self, data_path, catalog_id=None, output_dir=None, delete_dir=False, **kwargs)``
        - ``check_status(self, flow_id=None, flow_instance_id=None, raw=False)``
        - ``logout(self)``
        
        The arguments operate in the same fashion as the CLI options, and are
        documented in detail in the method docstrings.
