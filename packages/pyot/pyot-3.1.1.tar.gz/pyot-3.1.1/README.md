[![MIT Licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](https://github.com/paaksing/pyot/blob/master/LICENSE)

Pyot is an asyncIO based high-level Python Riot Games API framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced Riot Games Third Party Developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of the Riot Games API, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

### Pyot 3

- Code will run 3 ~ 5 times faster compared to Pyot 2.
- Support for RoleML and Roleidentification.
- Refactored objects to use non-destructive design.

Migration Guide: [Version 2 → 3](https://paaksing.github.io/Pyot/core/v2tov3.html)

### Pyot 3.1

- MongoDB is NOT compatible of v3.0, it now uses bson format for caching, after updating to v3.1, old items are automatically deleted progressively when accessed. To maintain old cached items, run the migration function detailed in the migration guide.
- Reworked LoL Spectator objects, added support for Roleidentification.
- Generic typing on most utils functions and classes.

Migration Guide: [Version 3.0 → 3.1](https://paaksing.github.io/Pyot/core/v3tov31.html)

## Features

Features that Pyot has and can provide to your development.

- **_AsyncIO Based_**: Go 60x faster with asyncIO and coroutines, highly configurable settings and wide range of tools to speed your I/O tasks.
- **_Django Support_**: Full support for Django Caches Framework and its new 3.1 async Views, enable as installed app and point your setting modules on your `settings.py` file.
- **_Community Projects Integrated_**: Includes support for CDragon, MerakiCDN, RoleML, RoleIdentification. DDragon is Forbidden due to incompatible APIs.
- **_Caches Integrated_**: A wide range of Caches Stores is available right out of the box, we currently have Omnistone(Runtime), RedisCache(RAM), DiskCache(Disk) and MongoDB(NoSQL).
- **_Multiple Models_**: Available models are League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, Legends of Runeterra and VALORANT.
- **_Code Autocompletion_**: Access data through attributes and properties, maximize your code efficiency now with autocompletion.
- **_Perfect Rate Limiter_**: Pyot's Rate Limiter is production tested in all asynchronous, multithreaded and even multiprocessed environments. Pyot's rate limiters are made for perfectionists.
- **_User Friendly Docs_**: Meet a human redable documentation that covers guides and all the available high-level and low-level APIs in Pyot.
- **_Synchronous Compatible_**: An adapted version of Pyot that runs on synchronous environment, exposing part of its API synchronously on Syot.

1. First, read the **[Installation Guide](https://paaksing.github.io/Pyot/core/installation.html)** for instructions on installing Pyot.
2. Next, follow the quick start guide in **[Quick Start Guide](https://paaksing.github.io/Pyot/core/startup.html)** for creating and running your first Pyot project.
3. Then you should get to know the types of objects that Pyot works with in **[Objects](https://paaksing.github.io/Pyot/core/apiobjects.html)**.
4. Now give yourself an idea of what models we have and what objects we work in **[Models](https://paaksing.github.io/Pyot/models/)**
5. You'll probably want to read through the topical context managers for achieving concurrency in **[Gatherer](https://paaksing.github.io/Pyot/core/gatherer.html)** and **[Queue](https://paaksing.github.io/Pyot/core/queue.html)**.
6. From there you can jump back to manipulating the settings by reading **[Settings](https://paaksing.github.io/Pyot/core/settings.html)** and get to know all the available pipeline stores in Pyot at **[Stores](https://paaksing.github.io/Pyot/stores/)**.
7. Check out all the utils objects and methods available in `pyot.utils` that can be handy in your development, documented at **[Utils](https://paaksing.github.io/Pyot/utils/)**.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to open an issue in this repository.

Finally thanks for Django docs, I literally copied their doc format and changed the names. Yikes
