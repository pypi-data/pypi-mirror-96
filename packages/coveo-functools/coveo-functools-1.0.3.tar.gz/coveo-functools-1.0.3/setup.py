Can be configured with exceptions to ignore.\n\n```python\nfrom coveo_functools import wait\nimport requests\n\ndef _ready() -> bool:\n    return requests.get(\'/ping\').status_code == 200\n\nwait.until(_ready, timeout_s=30, retry_ms=100, handle_exceptions=ConnectionError,\n           failure_message="The service failed to respond in time.")\n```\n\n## wait.Backoff\n\nA customizable class to assist in the creation of backoff retry strategies.\n\n- Customizable growth factor\n- Jitter\n- Backoff progress % (want to fire some preliminary alarms at 50% backoff maybe?)\n- Supports infinite backoff\n- Can be configured to raise after too many attempts\n- Can be configured to raise after a set amount of time\n\ne.g.: Worker loop failure management by catching RetriesExhausted\n\n```python\nfrom coveo_functools.wait import Backoff\n\nbackoff = Backoff()\nwhile my_loop:\n    try:\n        do_stuff()\n    except Exception as exception:\n        try:\n            quit_flag.wait(next(backoff))\n        except backoff.RetriesExhausted:\n            raise exception\n```\n\ne.g.: Worker loop failure management without the nested try/catch:\n\n```python\nfrom coveo_functools.wait import Backoff\n\nbackoff = Backoff()\nwhile my_loop:\n    try:\n        do_stuff()\n    except Exception as exception:\n        wait_time = next(backoff, None)\n        if wait_time is None:\n            raise exception\n        quit_flag.wait(wait_time)\n```\n\ne.g.: You can generate the wait times without creating a Backoff instance, too:\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom coveo_functools.wait import Backoff\n\nwait_times = list(Backoff.generate_backoff_stages(first_wait, growth, max_backoff))\nfor sleep_time in wait_times:\n    try:\n        do_stuff()\n        break\n    except:\n        time.sleep(sleep_time)\nelse:\n    raise ImSickOfTrying()\n```\n',
