"""
RocketPy is a trajectory simulation for High-Power Rocketry built by
[Projeto Jupiter](https://www.facebook.com/ProjetoJupiter/). The code allows
for a complete 6 degrees of freedom simulation of a rocket's flight trajectory,
including high fidelity variable mass effects as well as descent under
parachutes. Weather conditions, such as wind profile, can be imported from
sophisticated datasets, allowing for realistic scenarios. Furthermore, the
implementation facilitates complex simulations, such as multi-stage rockets,
design and trajectory optimization and dispersion analysis.
