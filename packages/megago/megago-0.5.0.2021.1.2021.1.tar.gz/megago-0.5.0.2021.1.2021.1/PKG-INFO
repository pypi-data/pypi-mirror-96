Description: 
        Mega-GO calculates the similarity between GO terms with the relevance semantic similarity (sim<sub>Rel</sub>) metric.
        The program reads one or more input FASTA files.
        For each file it computes a variety of statistics, and then
        prints a summary of the statistics as output.
        
        The goal is to provide a solid foundation for new bioinformatics command line tools,
        and is an ideal starting place for new projects.
