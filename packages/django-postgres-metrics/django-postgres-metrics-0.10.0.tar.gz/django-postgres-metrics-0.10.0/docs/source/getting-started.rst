Getting Started
===============

.. currentmodule:: postgres_metrics

Installation
------------

Start by installing ``django-postgres-metrics`` from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install django-postgres-metrics

You will also need to make sure to have ``psycopg2`` or ``psycopg2-binary``
installed which is already a requirement by Django for PostgreSQL support
anyway.

Then you need to add ``postgres_metrics`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list. Due
to the way postgres_metrics works, you need to include it *before* the
``admin`` app:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'postgres_metrics.apps.PostgresMetrics',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    ]

You also need to make sure that the ``request`` context processor is included
in the ``TEMPLATES`` setting. It is included by default for projects that were
started on Django 1.8 or later:

.. code-block:: python

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
            'OPTIONS': {
                'context_processors': [
                    ...,
                    'django.template.context_processors.request',
                    ...,
                ],
            },
        },
    ]

Lastly, you need to add a URL path to your global ``urls.py`` *before* the
``admin`` URL patterns.

For Django 2.0 and up:

.. code-block:: bash

    from django.urls import include, path
    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/postgres-metrics/', include('postgres_metrics.urls')),
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ]

Congratulations, you made it!

When you now browse to the Django Admin with superuser permissions, you'll see
a "PostgreSQL Metrics" section at the bottom left, listing all available
metrics.

This is what a metric could look like:

Designing Your Own Metric
-------------------------

First, you need to import a base class that all metrics inherit from. This will
take care of fetching the data from the database, implement sorting if you
want, and provide per record and per item in a record styling. Furthermore, you
need to make your metric know to django-postgres_metrics-metrics:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

    from postgres_metrics.metrics import Metric, registry


    class DjangoMigrationStatistics(Metric):
        """
        Count the number of applied Django migrations per app and sort by
        descending count and ascending app name.
        """
        label - _('Migration Statistics')
        slug - 'django-migration-statistics'
        ordering - '-2.1'
        sql - '''
            SELECT
                app, count(*)
            FROM
                django_migrations
            GROUP BY
                app
            {ORDER_BY}
            ;
        '''


    registry.register(DjangoMigrationStatistics)

A short explanation of what the metric class attributes do:

:docstring:
   This will be shown above the metric's output and allow you to give an
   explanation what you see.

:label:
   This is what you see on the Django Admin index page as a metric name.

:slug:
   A unique identifier for a metric. This will be used as part of the URL.

:ordering:
   The default ordering you want to use in the metric. Use column indexes
   (one-indexed) and prefix with ``-`` for descending sorting.

:sql:
   The actual SQL you want to run. The ``{ORDER_BY}`` part is replaced with
   ``ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1`` in the example.

Styling Metric Output
---------------------

Styling Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to highlight some of the output rows you can define a
:class:`~metrics.Metric.get_record_style` method on a metric class:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyMetric(Metric):
        ...

        def get_record_style(self, record):
            if record[0]:
                if record[1] > 1000:
                    return 'critical'
                if record[1] > 100:
                    return 'warning'
                if record[1] == 0:
                    return 'info'
                return 'ok'

The ``record`` parameter is a tuple with all values of a single row in the
output. This method will be called for every single row being outputted. Don't
do any expensive calculations here!

django-postgres-metrics ships four pre-defined styles: ``ok``, ``warning``,
``critical`` and ``info`` that you can return.

Styling Record Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly, you can highlight a single value in the metric output by using the
:class:`~metrics.Metric.get_record_item_style` method on a metric class:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyMetric(Metric):
        ...

        def get_record_item_style(self, record, itme, index):
            if index == 2 and record[1]:
                if item > 1000:
                    return 'critical'
                if item > 100:
                    return 'warning'
                if item == 0:
                    return 'info'
                return 'ok'

Along with the ``record`` you get the current value or ``item`` and the (zero-
indexed) position of the item in the record. The item is provided for
convenience and is defined as ``item = record[index]``.
