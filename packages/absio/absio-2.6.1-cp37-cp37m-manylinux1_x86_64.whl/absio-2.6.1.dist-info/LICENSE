the Software's nonconformance to any documentation we provide, so long as

resolution will include an update to the Software that will resolve or fix the
reported issue.

            commands is inoperable; or the use is otherwise significantly impacted;
            licensing issues not related to the deployment of the user's product.

            does not provide a function in the most convenient or expeditious manner
            or produces incorrect results, and the user suffers little or no significant
            impact.

and mitigate risk associated with the use of the Software.  The provisions of this Agreement are
designed to allocate risk consistent with these realities.  You accordingly acknowledge that you
understand that an essential purpose of the exclusion of warranties, the indemnification and
limitation of liability provided in this Agreement is allocation of risks between both of us, which
allocation of risks is reflected in the applicable fees and other arrangements between both of us
in the Agreement, and that we would not be willing to enter into this Agreement with you and
license the Software to you if we were required to bear any additional risk.
