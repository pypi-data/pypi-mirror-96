color-matcher enables color transfer across images which comes in handy for automatic color-grading
of photographs, paintings and film sequences as well as light-field and stopmotion corrections. The methods behind
the mappings are based on the approach from Reinhard et al., an analytical solution to a Multi-Variate Gaussian
Distribution (MVGD) transfer, the Monge-Kantorovich solution as proposed by Pitie et al. and classical histogram
matching.
