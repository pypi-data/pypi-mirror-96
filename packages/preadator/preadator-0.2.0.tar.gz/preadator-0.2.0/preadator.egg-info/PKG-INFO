        # Bugs
        
        Preadator is designed to work in Python >= 3.7, but there is a 
        [bug in Python](https://bugs.python.org/issue39098)
        in the `ProcessPoolExecutor` that causes an `OSError` with
        `.shutdown(wait=False)`.
        
        Since the bug is in Python itself, currently only Python 3.9 is supported. If
        the bug is fixed, then Preadator will support older versions of Python.
        
        ## Install
