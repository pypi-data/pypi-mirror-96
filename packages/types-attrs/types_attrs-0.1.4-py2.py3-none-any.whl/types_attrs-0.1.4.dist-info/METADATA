## Typing stubs for attrs

This is an auto-generated PEP 561 type stub package for `attrs` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `attrs`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/attrs. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `a1f16da64ea185f3b53dd3919ff9944cb73a9652`.
