The payments of owners
======================

Following a long distance call, co-owners report their payments to the trustee.

To enter, go to third-part record from the list of co-owner *General /condominium/Sets and owners*.

Then add a payment specifying the date, amount, a payment reference (as the check number) and the accounting has to be charged.

The accounting entries are automatically made fog.
The situation of the co-owner is also set to days.
