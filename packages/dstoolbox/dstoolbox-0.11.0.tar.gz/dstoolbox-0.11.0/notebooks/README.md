# Notebooks

These notebooks are organized according to the individual dstoolbox
modules. If you want to see examples of how to use specific dstoolbox
classes or functions, this is the right place. If you just want to see
some notable examples, have a look at the 
[showcase notebook](https://github.com/ottogroup/dstoolbox/blob/master/notebooks/Showcase.ipynb).
