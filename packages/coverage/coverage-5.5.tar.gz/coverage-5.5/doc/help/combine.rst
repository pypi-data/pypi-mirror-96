    $ coverage combine --help
    Usage: coverage combine [options] <path1> <path2> ... <pathN>

    Combine data from multiple coverage files collected with 'run -p'.  The
    combined results are written to a single file representing the union of the
    data. The positional arguments are data files or directories containing data
    files. If no paths are provided, data files in the default data file's
    directory are combined.

    Options:
      -a, --append     Append coverage data to .coverage, otherwise it starts
                       clean each time.
      --keep           Keep original coverage files, otherwise they are deleted.
      --debug=OPTS     Debug options, separated by commas. [env: COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help       Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE  Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                       'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are tried.
                       [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]
