# Setup twitpy
Let's install twitpy first.
```
pip install twitpy
```

Now we need to actually setup the module by registring our API Keys.

```python
import twitpy
Access = twitpy.accesstwitpy("access_token","access_token_secret","consumer_key","consumer_key_secret")
```
You need 4 API keys to access twitpy. You need a Twitter Developer Account for this, This is the MOST important step and without doing this you will not be able to access the API.

Now we have succesfully Accessed twitpy, Now we will use it's features.

# Picking user from retweet (retweet picker)

    print(i.full_text)
```
In the parenthesis of `get_tweetsfromuser` we write the Username first then we write the amount of tweets we want from the user, the number of tweets should be under 10,because `gettweets` was a list due to having 10 tweets it has to be looped through, `get_tweetsfromuser` returns the following attributes.
