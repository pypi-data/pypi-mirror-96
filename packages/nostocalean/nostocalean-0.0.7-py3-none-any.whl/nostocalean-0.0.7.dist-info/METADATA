Custom utility functions.

This package contains a collection of utility functions for empirical work in Python.
It's in progress and the API may change often.

Nostocalean includes a wrapper for ``fixest::feols``

Example: Given a dataframe ``df`` with columns ``x, y, group, time`` 
run a regression of ``y`` on ``x`` with group and time fixed effects, and double cluster:

.. code-block:: python

    from nostocalean import ols

    summary = ols.reg("y ~ x | group + time", data=df, se="twoway")
    print(summary)

Nostocalean also includes several utility functions, including CES and HARA

Example: To sample a utility function, run:

.. code-block:: python

    from nostocalean.utility_functions import get_utility_function
    get_utility_function()
