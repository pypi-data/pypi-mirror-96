Description: # Why TOF-SIMS ?
        We needed a convenient way to explore the 3D datasets generated by a TESCAN FERA Xe plasma FIB-SEM with ToF-SIMS.  This package expands on the functions provided by the manufacturer.
        
        
        # Highlights
        ## Machine learning
        * Multivariate analysis with PCA, kPCA, IPCA
        * t-SNE clustering
        * Machine learning (KMeans)
        * Detailed cluster analysis
        
        
        ## Plots
        Available functions so far:
        * Read data from TOF-SIMS (.HDF5) files, making the data directly accessible in Python (numpy/pandas/matplotlib).
        * Generate top, sides projections, visualise surface before FIB-ing
        * Plot detected masses
        * Maximal projections for any given axis (x,y,z) and every isotopes/masses (useful to have a quick look at detected species).
        * Inspect top, side and depth projections for a given isotope/mass
        * Plot (and superpose) the abundance of species over any axis.
        * Overlays maximal projections.
        * Read in the complete file header. Get access to every setting of the machine recorded at the time of the experiment.
        * Export plots.
        * 3D interactive plot
        
        
        # Instructions
        Code in TOF-SIMS Notebook.ipynb should be self-explanatory.  If needed feel free to contact us at remi.branco@hotmail.fr or daniel.thomas.oldfield@gmail.com
        Help and feedback is very welcome.
        
        
        # What's next
        * More machine learning (DB-scan)
        * Better 3D plots (open3D)
        * Data reprocessing/peak-refining
        * Peak identification
        * Denoising with neural network
