# Basic SQL

This is a small package intended to help with basic operations such as select, insert, update, and upsert as well as executing raw SQL queries for different database types.

pip install psycopg2
```

```

### SQL Server (MSSQL)
```
pip install pyodbc
```
On Linux first follow the [Microsoft instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15) to install the required drivers.

### Oracle
```
pip install cx_Oracle
```
On Linux first follow the [Oracle instructions](https://www.oracle.com/au/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html#ic_x64_inst) to install the required drivers.
