Description: collective.collectionfilter
        ===========================
        
        Faceted navigation filter for collection results.
        
        This Plone 5 addon allows you to filter collections results for additional catalog metadata.
        For example, you can add a subject filter, but also a filter for authors or portal types.
        This can also be used to build tag clouds.
        
        The filter types can be extended (see: ``collective.collectionfilter.vocabularies``).
        
        There are three portlets/tiles available for filtering:
        
        ``Collection Filter``
            a list with values (select, radio, checkbox, link) you can filter on
        ``Collection Search``
            a SearchableText input field to do a fulltextsearch on the collection results
        ``Collection Maps``
            a LeafletJS map which shows and filters ``IGeolocatable`` items on it
            (this feature is available if ``collective.geolocationbehavior`` is installed and the behavior
            is activated on a contenttype. See installation notes below)
        ``Collection Result Listing Sort``
            a list of indexes where the user can sort the filtered result listing
        
        
        Filter Results with portlets
        ----------------------------
        
        Add as many of the filter portlets above to any context you want (most likely the source collection)
        and assign a collection with results to it.
        
        When you select values from the filter the results are loaded asynchronously inside the container
        with the selector defined in the field ``Content Selector``. Make sure the selector exists on the
        source collection template and on the target page which shows the filtered results.
        
        
        Mosaic Integration
        ------------------
        
        The three tiles can be added within the Mosaic editor multiple times. Just select them in the ``Insert`` menu
        and assign a collection to it. To show the results of the collection simply add a
        ``Existing Content`` tile which links to the same collection your filter tiles are assigned with.
        
        TODO: right now the collection needs a default_view template, which wraps the result list with a unique selector
        inside the ``#content-core`` container. so the collectionfilter can load the filtered result correctly from
        the collection into the container inside the existing content tile.
        
        
        Geolocation filter support
        --------------------------
        
        If ``collective.geolocationbehavior`` is installed, this package provides a LeafletJS Maps tile/portlet
        which shows each item of a collection result if the ``IGeolocatable`` information is available.
        In addition you can activate the ``Narrow down results`` checkbox to narrow down the collection result and
        other available filter tiles/portlets if the user moves or zooms the map.
        
        We provide a package extra to install all required dependencies with their according versions.
        Simply do this somewhere in your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs +=
                collective.collectionfilter[geolocation]
            ...
        
        
        Overloading GroupByCriteria
        ---------------------------
        
        ``collective.collectionfilter.vocabularies.GroupByCriteria`` is a singleton, registered as global utility and used to provide a list of possible indices, which grouped values will provide your filter criteria.
        
        It uses a data structure like this::
        
            self._groupby = {
                it: {                   # Index name
                    'index': it,             # Name of the index to use
                    'metadata': it,          # Name of the metadata column to use
                    'display_modifier': _ ,  # Function to prepare the metadata column value for displaying
                    'index_modifier': None,  # Function to transform the index search value.
                    'value_blacklist': [],   # Blacklist of index values, which should not included in the filter selection. Can be a callable.
                    'sort_key_function': lambda it: it['title'].lower(),  # sort key function. defaults to a lower-cased title
                }
                for it in metadata
            }
        
        As you can see, the standard GroupByCriteriaVocabulary implementation implies, that the index name is the same as the metadata column name.
        Also, we use the ``collective.collectionfilter`` message catalog as standard display_modifier (you can register translations under the ``collective.collectionfilter`` domain to translate index values).
        
        If you need a special ``display_modifier``, or index or metadata columns do not have the same identifier, you can modify this data structure.
        For that, register an adapter for ``IGroupByModifier``, which adapts to the GroupByCriteria utility.
        Within this adapter, you can modify the already populated ``_groupby`` attribute (do not use the ``groupby``, which is a property method and at this point hasn't finished).
        
        This is how.
        
        Write an adapter::
        
            # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
            from collective.collectionfilter.interfaces import IGroupByCriteria
            from collective.collectionfilter.interfaces import IGroupByModifier
            from zope.component import adapter
            from zope.interface import implementer
        
        
            sort_map = {
                'VALUE1': 3,
                'VALUE2': 1,
                'VALUE3': 2,
            }
        
        
            def subjectsort(it):
                # Sorts the value after a fixed sort map
                val = it['title']
                return sort_map.get(val, 0)
        
        
            @implementer(IGroupByModifier)
            @adapter(IGroupByCriteria)
            def groupby_modifier(groupby):
                groupby._groupby['Subject']['display_modifier'] = lambda x: x.upper()
                groupby._groupby['Subject']['sort_key_function'] = subjectsort
                groupby._groupby['my_new_index'] = {
                    'index': 'my_new_index',
                    'metadata': 'my_new_index_metadata_colum',
                    'display_modifier': lambda it: u'this is awesome: {0}'.format(it)
                }
        
        Register the adapter::
        
            <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope">
              <adapter factory=".collectionfilter.groupby_modifier" name="modifier_1" />
            </configure>
        
        Done.
        
        Your adapter is called by ``collective.collectionfilter.vocabularies.GroupByCriteria.groupby``.
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        This package is compatible with Plone 5 and above. Note that in 5.0 some functionality is reduced such as AJAX loading of search results.
        If your theme doesn't work well with AJAX loading this can be overridden in the registery or via diazo.

        2.1 (2019-03-22)
        ----------------
        
        New features:
        
        - Python 3 compatibility.
          [agitator]
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - Do not render an empty ``filterClassName``.
          [thet]

        ------------------
        
        - Fix upgrade steps and reapply profile to fix bundle registration
          Remove conditional reinitialization - caused problems with other patterns
          [agitator]
        
        
        2.0 (2018-12-08)
        ----------------
        
        Breaking changes:
        
        - Remove the ``cache_time`` setting and replace it with ``cache_enabled``.
        
        - collectionsearch.pt: changed view attribute ``header_title`` to ``title``.
        
        - Depend on plone.app.contenttypes.
          All target collections must provide ``plone.app.contenttypes.behaviors.collection.ICollection`` interface.
          The ``result`` method will be callend on this behavior adapter.
        
        - There is a implicit dependency to Font Awesome for the filter tile edit links.
          That has to be revisited to make it work out of the box.
        
        - Modernized markup for easier styling
        
        New:
        
        - Optimize the cache key by including the current language, user roles instead of id and the database counter.
        
        - Remove the view_name part when populating the browser history with filter changes.
          The view_name part is for loading specific AJAX tiles, but should probably not be displayed.
        
        - Add filter and search tiles.
        
        - Add a ``sort_key_function`` key to the IQueryModifier dict to allow for a different sort key function when sorting the values.
        
        - Add a ``index_modifier`` key to the IQueryModifier indexes dict to allow transforming of index search values.
          For ``KeywordIndex`` indices the index_modifier is automatically set to encode the value to utf-8.
        
        - Add a ``value_blacklist`` key to the IQueryModifier indexes dict to allow blacklisting of individual index values.
        
        - Add ``view_name`` configuration parameter to call a special result listing view.
          This can be used to call a tile instead to call the whole context view.
        
        - Add ``content_selector`` configuration parameter to choose a DOM node from the source to inject into the target.
        
        - Ensure early exit on the content filter traverse handler if it is not needed to run.
        
        - Make backwards compatible with Plone 5.0
          [nngu6036, instification]
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - When reloading the collection in JavaScript, use the content selector's parent as base to trigger events on.
          The content selector itself is replaced and events cannot be catched.
        
        - Register the bundle compile files as ``collectionfilter-bundle-compiled.js`` and ``collectionfilter-bundle-compiled.css``, so that using ``plone-compile-resources`` results in the same files.
          See: https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/2437
        
        - Sort the filter value list for filter title instead filter value.
        
        - fix collectionsearch portlet
          [petschki]
        
        - when providing a custom `IGroupByCriteria` adapter, fallback to title sorted values if no sort_key_function is given.
          [petschki]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2018-02-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix target collection selection via catalog vocabular and RelatedItemsFieldWidget.
          [agitator]
        
        
        1.0 (2018-01-27)

        - Implement AJAX search for the collection search portlet.
          [thet]
        
        - Update the history / location bar URL with the current filter URL.
          [thet]

          Fixes #6.
          [agitator]
        
        - Register bundle to depend on ``*`` to avoid weird Select2 initialization error.
          [thet]
        
        - Add ``input_type`` option to be able to better select the type of input.
          Add ``input_type`` support for dropdowns.
          Remove ``as_input`` attribute and provide upgrade step for it.
          [thet]
        
        - Initial release from collective.portlet.collectionfilter.
