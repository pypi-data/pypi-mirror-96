## Prerequisites
To use Aspose Slides Cloud SDK for Python you need to register an account with [Aspose Cloud](https://www.aspose.cloud/) and lookup/create App Key and SID at [Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps). There is free quota available. For more details, see [Aspose Cloud Pricing](https://purchase.aspose.cloud/pricing).

### Installation

```sh
python -m pip install asposeslidescloud
```

### Sample usage

The example code below converts a PowerPoint document to PDF format using asposeslidescloud library:
```python
	import asposeslidescloud

	from asposeslidescloud.configuration import Configuration
	from asposeslidescloud.apis.slides_api import SlidesApi
	from asposeslidescloud.models.export_format import ExportFormat
	from asposeslidescloud.models.requests.slides_api_requests import PostSlidesConvertRequest

	configuration = Configuration()
	configuration.app_sid = 'MyClientId'
	configuration.app_key = 'MyClientSecret'
	api = SlidesApi(configuration)

	with open("MyPresentation.pptx", 'rb') as f:
		document = f.read()

	request = PostSlidesConvertRequest(ExportFormat.PDF, document)
	response = api.post_slides_convert(request)
	print('My PDF was saved to ' + response)
```
