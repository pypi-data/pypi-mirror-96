Description: # tickle: A rock climbing ticklist manager.
        
        This is a web application for managing your rock climbing ticklists. It is
        written as a Django app.
        
        Currently it's not in a consumable state, but eventually I'm hoping to release
        this as a PyPi package which will be usable as an import in Django websites.
