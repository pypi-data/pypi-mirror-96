Description: # soft-brownian-offset
        Soft Brownian Offset (SBO) defines an iterative approach to translate points by a most likely distance from a given dataset.
        It can be used for generating out-of-distribution samples.
        
        ## Installation
        
        This project is hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sbo/) and can therefore be installed easily through `pip`:
        
        ```
        pip install sbo
        ```
        
        Dependending on your setup you may need to add `--user` after the `install`.
        
        ## Usage
        
        For brevity's sake here's a short introduction to the library's usage:
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.datasets import make_moons
        from sbo import soft_brownian_offset
        
        X, _ = make_moons(n_samples=60, noise=.08)
        X_ood = soft_brownian_offset(X, d_min=.35, d_off=.24, n_samples=120, softness=0)
        ```
        
        For more details please see the [documentation](https://soft-brownian-offset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        
        ## Background
