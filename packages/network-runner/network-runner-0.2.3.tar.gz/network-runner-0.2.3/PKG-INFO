Description: ======================================
        Network-Runner: Ansible Networking API
        ======================================
        
        Overview
        --------
        Network-Runner is a python library that abstracts management and
        interaction with switching hardware to Ansible Networking. This library is not
        tested with all the modules included with Ansible Networking. In theory it
        should work with any switch that has compatible modules included with Ansible
        Networking if the provider tasks are added to this library's Ansible role.
        See the contributor documentation for more information
        about adding support for an Ansible Networking module to this library.

        Components
        ----------
        The Network-Runner library consists of the following components:
        
        ``Python API``
          Imported directly by python.
        
        ``Ansible Role``
          Used by Ansible during Ansible invocation.
        
        Use Cases
        ---------
        ``Python API``
        
        Any python application could need the ability to communicate with a switch
        to perform a task that network-runner is able to complete. The interaction
        with ansible is designed in a library style that will allow direct import and
        invocation in python independent of a running OpenStack deployment.
