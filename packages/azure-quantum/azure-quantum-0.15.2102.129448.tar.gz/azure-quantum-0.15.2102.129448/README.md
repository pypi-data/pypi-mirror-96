# Python SDK for Azure Quantum #

The `azure-quantum` package for Python provides functionality for interacting with Azure Quantum workspaces,
including creating jobs, listing jobs, and retrieving job results.

For details on how to get started with Azure Quantum, please visit https://azure.com/quantum.

## Installing with pip ##

```bash
pip install azure-quantum
```

## Building the `azure-quantum` Package ##

The Azure Quantum Python SDK uses a standard `setuptools`-based packaging strategy.
To build a platform-independent wheel, run the setup script with `bdist_wheel` instead:

```bash
cd src/Python/
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

By default, this will create a `azure-quantum` wheel in `dist/` with the version number set to 0.0.0.1.
To provide a more useful version number, set the `PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable before running `setup.py`.
