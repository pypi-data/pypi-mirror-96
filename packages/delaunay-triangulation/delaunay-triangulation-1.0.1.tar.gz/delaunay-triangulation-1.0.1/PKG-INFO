Description: # Installing
        ### Python 3.6 or higher is required
        other than that it's just as simple as
        ```
        pip install delaunay-triangulation
        ```
        
        # Features
        ## Geometry Math Classes - typing.py
        ### StandardLine
        A line in a coordinate grid described in standard form (ax + by = c).
        
        ### Coordinate
        A single x or y coordinate that doesn't have a specific value yet.
        
        ### Vertex
        A Vertex - a point in 2D space described by an x and y value.
        
        ### Edge
        An Edge - a line(AB) in 2D space described by 2 vertices
        
        ### Triangle
        A Triangle represented as 3 vertices a, b, c
        
        ### Circle
        A Circle described by its center and its radius
        
        ## Calculation Methods - triangulation.py
        ### scatter_vertices
        helper method to scatter random vertices on a specified plane.
        
        ### get_super_triangle
        get super triangle from vertices
        
        ### delaunay
        the crux of this package. A method to Delaunay Triangulate a list of vertices using the Bowyer-Watson algorithm.
        
        # Basic usage
        ```python
        from delaunay_triangulation.triangulate import scatter_vertices, delaunay
        
        width = 1920
        height = 1080
        spacing = 250
        scatter = 0.75
        
        vertices = scatter_vertices(
            plane_width=width,
            plane_height=height,
            spacing=spacing,
            scatter=scatter
        )
        
        # delete_super_shared is True by default but can be turned off if you need to fill a plane completely
        triangles = delaunay(
            vertices=vertices,
            delete_super_shared=False
        )
        ```
        You are now free to do with those triangles what ever you may desire!
