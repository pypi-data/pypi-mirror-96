.SH NAME
.sp
cdist\-type__ufw_rule \- A single UFW rule
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Adds or removes a single UFW rule. This type supports adding and deleting rules for port ranges or applications.
.sp
Understanding what is "to" and what is "from" can be confusing. If the rule is ingress (default), then "from" is the remote machine and "to" is the local one. The opposite is true for egress traffic (\-\-out).
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B state
Either "present" or "absent". Defaults to "present". If "absent", only removes rules that exactly match the rule expected.
.TP
.B rule
A firewall rule in UFW syntax. This is what you would usually write after \fIufw\fP on the command line. Defaults to "allow" followed by the object ID. You can use either the short syntax (just allow|deny|reject|limit followed by a port or application name) or the full syntax. Do not include \fIdelete\fP in your command. Set \fI\-\-state absent\fP instead.
