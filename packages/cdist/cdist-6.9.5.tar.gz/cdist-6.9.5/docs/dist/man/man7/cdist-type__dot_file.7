# Install .forward file for user \(aqalice\(aq. Since state is \(aqpresent\(aq,
# user is not meant to edit this file, all changes will be overridden.
# It is good idea to put warning about it in file itself.
__dot_file .forward \-\-user alice \-\-source "$__files/forward"

# Install .muttrc for user \(aqbob\(aq, if not already present. User can safely
# edit it, his changes will not be overwritten.

# Install default xmonad config for user \(aqeve\(aq. Parent directory is created automatically.
