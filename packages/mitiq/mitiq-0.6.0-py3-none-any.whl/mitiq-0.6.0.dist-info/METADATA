# Mitiq

Mitiq is a Python toolkit for implementing error mitigation techniques on quantum computers.

Current quantum computers
are noisy due to interactions with the environment, imperfect gate applications, state preparation and measurement
errors, etc. Error mitigation seeks to reduce these effects at the software level by compiling quantum programs in
clever ways.

Want to know more? Check out our [documentation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/guide-overview.html).

## Installation

Mitiq can be installed from PyPi via

```bash
pip install mitiq
```

To test installation, run

```python
import mitiq
mitiq.about()
```

This prints out version information about core requirements and optional quantum software packages which Mitiq can
interface with.

If you'd prefer to clone and install from source, our would like to develop Mitiq, check out the
[contribution guidelines](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/toc_contributing.html) for more information.

### Supported quantum programming libraries

Mitiq can currently interface with:

* [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq),
* [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/),
* [pyQuil](https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil).

Cirq is a core requirement of Mitiq and is automatically installed. To use Mitiq with other quantum programming
libraries, install the optional package(s) following the instructions linked above.

### Supported quantum processors

Mitiq can be used on any quantum processor which can be accessed by supported quantum programming libraries and is
available to the user.

## Getting started

See the [getting started](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/guide-getting-started.html) guide in
[Mitiq's documentation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io) for a complete walkthrough of how to use mitiq. For
a quick preview, check out the following snippet for a simple example of Mitiq in action:

```python
import numpy as np
from cirq import depolarize, Circuit, DensityMatrixSimulator, LineQubit, X
from mitiq import execute_with_zne

def noisy_simulation(circ: Circuit) -> float:
    """Simulates a circuit with depolarizing noise.

    Args:
        circ: The quantum program as a Cirq Circuit.

    Returns:
        The expectation value of the |0><0| observable.
    """
    circuit = circ.with_noise(depolarize(p=0.001))
    rho = DensityMatrixSimulator().simulate(circuit).final_density_matrix
    return np.real(np.trace(rho @ np.diag([1, 0])))

# simple circuit that should compose to the identity when noiseless
circ = Circuit(X(LineQubit(0)) for _ in range(80))

# run the circuit using a density matrix simulator with depolarizing noise
unmitigated = noisy_simulation(circ)
print(f"Error in simulation (w/o  mitigation): {1.0 - unmitigated:.{3}}")

# run again, but using mitiq's zero-noise extrapolation to mitigate errors
mitigated = execute_with_zne(circ, noisy_simulation)
print(f"Error in simulation (with mitigation): {1.0 - mitigated:.{3}}")
```
Sample output:
```
Error in simulation (w/o  mitigation): 0.0506
Error in simulation (with mitigation): 0.000519
```

## Error mitigation techniques

Mitiq currently implements:
* [Zero-Noise Extrapolation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/guide-zne.html),
* [Probabilistic Error Cancellation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/guide-getting-started.html#error-mitigation-with-probabilistic-error-cancellation),

and is designed to support [additional techniques](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/wiki).
