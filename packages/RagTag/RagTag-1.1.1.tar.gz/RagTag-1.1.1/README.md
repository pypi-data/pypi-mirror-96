## Getting Started

```bash
# install with conda
conda install -c bioconda ragtag

# correct contigs
ragtag.py correct ref.fasta query.fasta

# scaffold contigs
ragtag.py scaffold ref.fa ragtag_output/query.corrected.fasta

# scaffold with multiple references
ragtag.py scaffold -o out_1 ref1.fasta query.fasta
ragtag.py scaffold -o out_2 ref2.fasta query.fasta
ragtag.py merge query.fasta out_*/*.agp

# use Hi-C to resolve conflicts
ragtag.py merge -b hic.bam query.fasta out_*/*.agp
```

## Acknowledgments

Many of the major algorithmic improvements relative to RaGOO's first release were provided by Aleksey Zimin, lead developer of the [MaSuRCA assembler](https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca). This includes the use of read-mapping for misassembly validation as well as the use of alignment merging for improved scaffolding. [Luca Venturini](https://github.com/lucventurini) also suggested and initially implemented many feature enhancments, such as pysam integration. RagTag "merge" was inspired by [CAMSA](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1919-y). The developer of CAMSA, [Sergey Aganezov](https://github.com/aganezov), helped review relevant RagTag code.
