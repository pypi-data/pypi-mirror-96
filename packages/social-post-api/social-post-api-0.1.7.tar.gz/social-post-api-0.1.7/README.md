# Automated Social Media Posting APIs

<img src="https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ayr-logo-2156-reduced.png" width="400">

Social Post API is a client for [Ayrshare's](https://www.ayrshare.com) APIs. Ayrshare is a powerful set of APIs that enable you to automate server-side social media posts to *Twitter*, *Instagram*, *Facebook*, *LinkedIn*, *YouTube*, *Reddit*, and *Telegram* for your company on behalf of your users. 

The Ayrshare API handles all the setup and maintenance for the social media networks. One API to rule them all (yeah, went there). See the [full list of features](https://docs.ayrshare.com/rest-api/overview).

If you have a platform or manage multiple clients [contact us](https://www.ayrshare.com/business-plan-for-all-your-clients/) about the business plan.

``` python

# Post to Platforms Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn
postResult = social.post({'post': 'Nice Posting 2', 'platforms': ['twitter', 'facebook', 'linkedin']})
print(postResult)

# Delete

```
