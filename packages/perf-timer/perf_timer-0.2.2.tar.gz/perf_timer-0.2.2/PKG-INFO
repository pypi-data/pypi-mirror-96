Description: 
        PerfTimer is an instrumenting timer which provides an easy way to
        get insight into call count and average execution time of a function
        or piece of code during a real session of your program.
        
        Use cases include:
          * check the effects of algorithm tweaks, new implementations, etc.
          * confirm the performance of a library you are considering under
          actual use by your app (as opposed to upstream's artificial
          benchmarks)
          * measure CPU overhead of networking or other asynchronous I/O
          (currently supported: OS threads, Trio async/await)
