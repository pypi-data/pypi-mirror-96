        # Zai
        
        Zai is a small programming language which I wrote for fun. The language:
        
        - Is Dynamically typed
        - Is Entirely written in Python
        - Supports classes
        - Supports first-class functions
        - Supports writing and importing modules
        
        **NOTE:** This is a project made for both learning and fun. It is not meant to be used in serious projects.
        # Examples
        Coming Soon...
        
        # Missing Features and Future Improvements
        Here is a list of the features which are currently missing but will be implemented in the future
        - [ ] Basic class inheritance
        - [ ] Floating Point Numbers
        - [ ] Prefix/Postfix increment and decrement operators
        - [ ] Better test suite
        - [ ] Importing and calling native python functions(Maybe...)
        
        # Internals and Documentation
        - The language grammar can be found within the [docs/grammar file](https://github.com/sehnsucht13/zai-pl/blob/master/docs/grammar)
        - Some more in-depth details about the implementation(how objects are represented internally, environment...) can be found within [docs/architecture.md file](https://github.com/sehnsucht13/zai-pl/blob/master/docs/architecture.md)
