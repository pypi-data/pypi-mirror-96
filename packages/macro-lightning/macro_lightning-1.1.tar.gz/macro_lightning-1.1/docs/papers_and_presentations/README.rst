Abstract:

	Macroscopic dark matter (macros) is a broad class of alternative candidates
	to particle dark matter. These candidates would transfer energy to matter
	primarily through  elastic scattering. A sufficiently large macro passing
	through the atmosphere would produce a straight channel of ionized plasma. If
	the cross-section of the macro is
	:math:`\sigma_x \gtrapprox 6 \times 10^{-9} cm^2`, then under atmospheric
	conditions conducive to lightning (eg. a thunderstorm) the plasma channel
	would be sufficient to seed a lightning strike with a single leader. This is
	entirely unlike ordinary bolt lightning in which a long sequence of hundreds
	or thousands of few-meter-long leaders are strung together. This
	macro-induced lightning would be extremely straight, and thus highly
	distinctive. Neither wind shear nor magnetohydrodynamic instabilities would
	markedly spoil its straightness. The only photographically documented case of
	a straight lightning bolt is probably not straight enough to have been
	macro-induced.

	We estimate the region of macro parameter space that could be probed by a
	search for straight lightning from the number of thunderstorms happening on
	Earth at any time. We also estimate the parameter space that can be probed by
	carefully monitoring Jupiter, e.g. using the Hubble Space Telescope.
