# Nextstrain CLI

This is the source code repository for a program called `nextstrain`, the
Nextstrain command-line interface (CLI).  It aims to provide a consistent way
to run and visualize pathogen builds and access Nextstrain components like
[Augur][] and [Auspice][] across computing environments such as [Docker][],
[Conda][], and [AWS Batch][].

Get started using the Nextstrain CLI by reading the [documentation][], which
includes installation and usage information.

If you'd like to contribute to development, the [development docs][] should
help you get going.  We're glad you'd like to contribute!

If you need help (or just want to say hi!), [open an issue][] or send us an
email to <hello@nextstrain.org>.
