"""
Checks your local setup to see if you have a supported build environment.

Three environments are supported, each of which will be tested:

  • Our Docker image is the preferred build environment.  Docker itself must
    be installed and configured on your computer first, but once it is, the
    build environment is robust and reproducible.

  • Your native ambient environment will be tested for snakemake, augur, and
    auspice. Their presence implies a working build environment, but does not
    guarantee it.

  • Remote jobs on AWS Batch.  Your AWS account, if credentials are available
    in your environment or via aws-cli configuration, will be tested for the
    presence of appropriate resources.  Their presence implies a working AWS
    Batch environment, but does not guarantee it.
