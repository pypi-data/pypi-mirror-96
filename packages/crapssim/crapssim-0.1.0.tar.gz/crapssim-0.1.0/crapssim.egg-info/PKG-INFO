Description: # CrapsSim
        
        Simulator for craps with various betting strategies
        
        ## About
        
        CrapsSim contains Python code to run all of the necessary elements of a craps table.  Currently supports running with `verbose=True` which prints out all actions at the table, or `verbose=False` for running many simulations.  Betting logic needs to be pre-specified.
        
        ## Results
        
        I will post results from this simulator on my personal site: http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kent/.
