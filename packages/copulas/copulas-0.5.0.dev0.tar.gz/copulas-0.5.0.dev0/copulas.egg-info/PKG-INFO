        # Overview
        
        * Website: https://sdv.dev
        * Documentation: https://sdv.dev/Copulas
        * Repository: https://github.com/sdv-dev/Copulas
        * License: [MIT](https://github.com/sdv-dev/Copulas/blob/master/LICENSE)
        * Development Status: [Pre-Alpha](https://pypi.org/search/?c=Development+Status+%3A%3A+2+-+Pre-Alpha)
        
        **Copulas** is a Python library for modeling multivariate distributions and sampling from them
        using [copula functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_%28probability_theory%29).
        Given a table containing numerical data, we can use Copulas to learn the distribution and
        later on generate new synthetic rows following the same statistical properties.
        
        Some of the features provided by this library include:
        
        * A variety of distributions for modeling univariate data.
        * Multiple Archimedean copulas for modeling bivariate data.
        * Gaussian and Vine copulas for modeling multivariate data.
        * Automatic selection of univariate distributions and bivariate copulas.

        * Student T
        * Truncated Gaussian

        # Install
        
        ## Requirements
        
        **Copulas** is part of the **SDV** project and is automatically installed alongside it. For
        details about this process please visit the [SDV Installation Guide](
        https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html)
        
        Optionally, **Copulas** can also be installed as a standalone library using the following commands:
        
        **Using `pip`:**
        
        ```bash
        pip install copulas
        ```
        
        **Using `conda`:**
        
        ```bash
        conda install -c sdv-dev -c conda-forge copulas
        ```
        
        For more installation options please visit the [Copulas installation Guide](INSTALL.md)
        
        # Quickstart
        
        In this short quickstart, we show how to model a multivariate dataset and then generate
        synthetic data that resembles it.
        
        ```python3
        import warnings
        warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
        
        from copulas.datasets import sample_trivariate_xyz
        from copulas.multivariate import GaussianMultivariate
        from copulas.visualization import compare_3d
        
        # Load a dataset with 3 columns that are not independent
        real_data = sample_trivariate_xyz()
        
        # Fit a gaussian copula to the data
        copula = GaussianMultivariate()
        copula.fit(real_data)
        
        # Sample synthetic data
        synthetic_data = copula.sample(len(real_data))
        
        # Plot the real and the synthetic data to compare
        compare_3d(real_data, synthetic_data)
        ```
        
        The output will be a figure with two plots, showing what both the real and the synthetic
        data that you just generated look like:
