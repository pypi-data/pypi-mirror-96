Description: # marvelcli
        
        A CLI wrapper for Marvelapp (https://marvelapp.com)
        
        The wrapper will enable you to interact with your Marvel
        account from the comfort of your command line.
        
        ## Getting started:
        
        `pip install marvelapp-cli`
        
        https://pypi.org/project/marvelapp-cli/
        
        ## Authing requests:
        
        You will need an access token to use the CLI, generate a new one or find the one you already have set up here: https://marvelapp.com/oauth/devtoken
        
        You can export your token by running this command from the same dir you installed the CLI:
        `export MARVEL_CLI_TOKEN='your access token'`
        
        The CLI will then automatically use this token for each command you run (so you don't have to auth each one individually).
        
        To unauth:
        `unset MARVEL_CLI_TOKEN`
        
        ## Example:
        
        To invite users to your workspace:
        
        	marvelcli add-collabs-to-project --project 12345 --email "janis@bigbrotherandtheholdingcompany.com" --email "stevie@fleetwoodmac.com" --email "grace@jeffersonairplane.com"
        
        ## Commands available:
        
        You can find out how to use each command with:
        
        	marvelcli [command name] --help
