Installation
------------

The easiest way install pyclowder is using pip and pulling from PyPI.
Use the following command to install::

    pip install pyclowder

Because this system is still under rapid development, you may want to
install by cloning the repo using the following commands::

    git clone https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bitbucket/scm/cats/pyclowder.git
    cd pyclowder
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py install

Or you can install directly from NCSA's Bitbucket::

    pip install -r https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bitbucket/projects/CATS/repos/pyclowder/raw/requirements.txt git+https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bitbucket/scm/cats/pyclowder.git
