# us-senate ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

A package for working with U.S. Senate metadata. Like [python-us](https://github.com/unitedstates/python-us), but for bills, Senator information, committee assignments and more!

(Note: This library represents rough half the functionality of the [`congress`](https://pypi.org/project/congress/) project, along with its counterpart, [`us-house`](https://pypi.org/project/us-house/). They are distributed separately so users have the option of keeping dependency bundles small.)

### Quickstart

```
$ pip install us-senate
```
