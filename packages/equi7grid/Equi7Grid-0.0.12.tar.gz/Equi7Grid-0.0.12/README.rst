A python class for working with Equi7Grid - how to convert to - how to use the tiling system - etc.

It's a python package that handles the geometric and geographic operations of a gridded and tiled projection system.
It was designed for data cubes ingesting satellite imagery and builds the basis for the Equi7Grid (see https://github.com/TUW-GEO/Equi7Grid).

A detailed documentation on the Equi7Grid definition is at:

Installation
============

This package should be installable through pip:

.. code::

    pip install Equi7Grid

Installs for scripy and gdal are required from conda or conda-forge.

Contribute
==========

We are happy if you want to contribute. Please raise an issue explaining what
is missing or if you find a bug. We will also gladly accept pull requests
against our master branch for new features or bug fixes.

Development setup
-----------------

For Development we recommend a ``conda`` environment.

Example installation script
---------------------------

The following script will install miniconda and setup the environment on a UNIX
like system. Miniconda will be installed into ``$HOME/miniconda``.

.. code::

   wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
   bash miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda
   export PATH="$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH"
   conda create -n equi7grid_env python=3.6 numpy scipy pip gdal pyproj shapely
   source activate equi7grid_env
   pip install pytileproj


This script adds ``$HOME/miniconda/bin`` temporarily to the ``PATH`` to do this
permanently add ``export PATH="$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH"`` to your ``.bashrc``
or ``.zshrc``

The last line in the example activates the ``equi7grid_env`` environment.

After that you should be able to run:

.. code::

    python setup.py test

to run the test suite.

Guidelines
----------

If you want to contribute please follow these steps:

- Fork the Equi7Grid repository to your account
- Clone the repository
- make a new feature branch from the Equi7Grid master branch
- Add your feature
- Please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories.
  We use py.test so a simple function called test_my_feature is enough
- submit a pull request to our master branch
