Your feedback will help us to turn this proof of concept into a comprehensive library.\n\n\n## Install\n\n\n`pip install ipyannotator`\n\n\n**dependencies (should be handled by pip)**\n\n```\npython = "^3.7"\ntraitlets = \'=4.3.3\'\nipycanvas = "^0.5.1"\nipyevents = "^0.8.0"\nipywidgets = "^7.5.1"\n```\n\n\n## Run ipyannotator as stand-alone web app using voila\n\nDependency resolution fails if `nbdev` and `voila` libraries are both listed in the same `pyproject.toml`. This should be fixed in the next major release of `nbdev` lib. \n\nThe easiest workaround atm:\n - install `ipyannotator` without dev dependencies \n - manually install `voila` into the same dev environment\n\nUsing `poetry`:\n\ninstall:\n```shell\ncd {project_root}\npoetry install --no-dev\npoetry run pip install voila\n```\nand run simple ipyannotator standalone example:\n```shell \npoetry run voila nbs/09_viola_example.ipynb --enable_nbextensions=True\n```\n\n  \nSame with `pip`:\n\n```shell\n   cd {project_root}\n   \n   pip install . \n   pip install voila\n   \n   voila nbs/09_viola_example.ipynb --enable_nbextensions=True\n```\n   \n\n# Documentation\n\nThis library has been written in the [literate programming style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) popularized for\njupyter notebooks by [nbdev](https://www.fast.ai/2019/12/02/nbdev/). Please explore the jupyter notebooks in `nbs/` to learn more about\nthe inner working of ipyannotator.\n\n\nAlso check out the following notebook for a more high level overview.\n\n- Tutorial demonstrating how ipyannotator can be seamlessly integrated in your\n\xa0\xa0\xa0 data science workflow. `nbs/08_tutorial_road_damage.ipynb`\n- Slides + recoding of jupytercon 2020 talk explaining the high level concepts / vision\n    of ipyannotator. TODO add public link\n\n## Jupyter lab trouble shooting\n\nFor clean (re)install make sure to have all the lab extencions active:\n\n`jupyter lab clean` to remove the staging and static directories from the lab \n\n _ipywidgets_:\n \n `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager`\n \n _ipycanvas_:\n \n `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager ipycanvas`\n \n _ipyevents_:\n \n `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager ipyevents`\n \n _nbdime_:\n \n `nbdime extensions --enable [--sys-prefix/--user/--system]`\n \n _viola_:\n \n `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-voila/jupyterlab-preview`\n\n\n# How to contribute\n\n\nCheck out `CONTRIBUTING.md` and since ipyannotator is build using nbdev reading\nthe [nbdev tutorial](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorial.html) and related docs will be very helpful.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\n\nCopyright 2020 onwards, Palaimon GmbH.
