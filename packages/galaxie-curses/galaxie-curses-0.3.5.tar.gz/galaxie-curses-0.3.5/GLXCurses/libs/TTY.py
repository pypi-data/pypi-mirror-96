        The timeout and wtimeout routines set blocking or non-blocking read for a given window.

        If delay is negative, blocking read is used (i.e., waits indefinitely for input).

        If delay is zero, then non-blocking read is used (i.e., read returns ERR if no input is waiting).

        If delay is positive, then read blocks for delay milliseconds, and returns ERR if there is still no input.

        Hence, these routines provide the same functionality as nodelay, plus the additional capability of
        being able to block for only delay milliseconds (where delay is positive).

        getch() returns an integer corresponding to the key pressed.

        If it is a normal character, the integer value will be equivalent to the character.
        Otherwise it returns a number which can be matched with the constants defined in curses.h.

        For example if the user presses F1, the integer returned is 265.

        This can be checked using the macro KEY_F() defined in curses.h.

        This makes reading keys portable and easy to manage.

        lowlevel_getch() will wait for the user to press a key, (unless you specified a timeout)
        and when user presses a key, the corresponding integer is returned.

        Then you can check the value returned with the constants defined in curses.h to match against the keys you want.
