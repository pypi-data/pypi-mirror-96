        =======
        Scripts for reading minimap2 PAF files
        
        Installation
        ===
        
        readpaf is contained in a single module so can be installed via PyPI:
        
        ```bash
        pip install readpaf
        ```
        
        inlcuding pandas:
        
        ```bash
        pip install readpaf[pandas]
        ```
        
        Or [readpaf.py](readpaf.py) can be directly downloaded like so
        
        using cURL
        
        ```bash
        curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexomics/read-paf/main/readpaf.py
        ```
        
        or wget
        
        ```bash
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexomics/read-paf/main/readpaf.py
        
        ```
        
        Usage
        ===
        
        The following script demonstrates how minimap2 output can be piped into read-paf 
        
        ```python
        from readpaf import parse_paf
        from sys import stdin
        
        for record in parse_paf(stdin):
            print(record.query_name, record.target_name)
        
        ```
        
        read-paf can also generate a pandas DataFrame:
        
        ```python
        from readpaf import parse_paf
        
        with open("test.paf", "r") as handle:
            df = parse_paf(handle, dataframe=True)
        
        ```
        
        Functions
        ===
        
        read-paf has a single user function
        
        parse_paf
        ---
        
        ```python
        parse_paf(file_like=file_handle, fields=list, dataframe=bool)
        ```
        Parameters:
        
         - **file_like:** A file like object, such as `sys.stdin`, a file handle from open or io.StringIO objects
         - **fields:** A list of 13 field names to use for the PAF file, default:
            ```python
            "query_name", "query_length", "query_start", "query_end", "strand",
            "target_name", "target_length", "target_start", "target_end",
            "residue_matches", "alignment_block_length", "mapping_quality", "tags"
            ```
            These are based on the [PAF specification](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm/blob/master/PAF.md).
         - **dataframe:** bool, if True, return a pandas.DataFrame with the tags expanded into separate Series
         
        If used as an iterator, then each object returned is a named tuple representing a single line in the PAF file. 
        Each named tuple has field names as specified by the `fields` parameter. The SAM-like tags are converted into 
        their correct types and stored in a dictionary.
        
        If used to generate a pandas DataFrame, then each row represents a line in the PAF file and the SAM-like tags 
        are expanded into individual series.
