        Recipe for compiling and installing software
        ********************************************
        
        .. contents::
        
        The recipe provides the means to compile and install source distributions
        using ``configure`` and ``make`` and other similar tools. It is inspired by
        the hexagonit.recipe.cmmi_ recipe but provides more control over the build process.

        Supported options
        =================
        
        ``url``
        
            URL to the package that will be downloaded and extracted. The
            supported package formats are .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, and .zip. The
            value must be a full URL,
            e.g. http://python.org/ftp/python/2.4.4/Python-2.4.4.tgz. The
            ``path`` option can not be used at the same time with ``url``.
        
        ``path``
        
            Path to a local directory containing the source code to be built
            and installed. The directory must contain the ``configure``
            script. The ``url`` option can not be used at the same time with
            ``path``.
        
        ``strip-top-level-dir``
        
            Omit the topmost directory of the package when unpacking.
            true or false. Defaults to false.
        
        ``prefix``
        
            Custom installation prefix passed to the ``--prefix`` option of the
            ``configure`` script. Defaults to the location of the part. Note that this
            is a convenience shortcut which assumes that the default ``configure``
            command is used to configure the package. If the ``configure-command``
            option is used to define a custom configure command no automatic
            ``--prefix`` injection takes place. You can also set the ``--prefix``
            parameter explicitly in ``configure-options``.
        
        ``shared``
        
            Specify the path in which this package is shared by many other
            packages.
            ``shared-part-list`` should be defined in ``[buildout]`` section
            Shared option is True or False
            The package will be installed on path/name/hash of options.
        
        ``md5sum``
        
            MD5 checksum for the package file. If available the MD5
            checksum of the downloaded package will be compared to this value
            and if the values do not match the execution of the recipe will
            fail.
        
        ``make-binary``
        
            Path to the ``make`` program. Defaults to 'make' which
            should work on any system that has the ``make`` program available
            in the system ``PATH``.
        
        ``make-options``
        
            Extra ``KEY=VALUE`` options included in the invocation of the ``make``
            program. Multiple options can be given on separate lines to increase
            readability.
        
        ``make-targets``
        
            Targets for the ``make`` command. Defaults to 'install'
            which will be enough to install most software packages. You only
            need to use this if you want to build alternate targets. Each
            target must be given on a separate line.
        
        ``configure-command``
        
            Name of the configure command that will be run to generate the Makefile.
            This defaults to ``./configure`` which is fine for packages that come with
            a configure script. You may wish to change this when compiling packages
            with a different set up. See the ``Compiling a Perl package`` section for
            an example.
        
        ``configure-options``
        
            Extra options to be given to the ``configure`` script. By default
            only the ``--prefix`` option is passed which is set to the part
            directory. Each option must be given on a separate line.
        
        ``patch-binary``
        
            Path to the ``patch`` program. Defaults to 'patch' which should
            work on any system that has the ``patch`` program available in the
            system ``PATH``.
        
        ``patch-options``
        
            Options passed to the ``patch`` program. Defaults to ``-p0``.
        
        ``patches``
        
            List of patch files to the applied to the extracted source. Each
            file should be given on a separate line.
        
        .. _Python hook scripts:
        
        ``pre-configure-hook``
        
            Custom python script that will be executed before running the
            ``configure`` script. The format of the options is::
        
                /path/to/the/module.py:name_of_callable
                url:name_of_callable
                url#md5sum:name_of_callable
        
            where the first part is a filesystem path or url to the python
            module and the second part is the name of the callable in the
            module that will be called.  The callable will be passed three
            parameters in the following order:
        
                1. The ``options`` dictionary from the recipe.
        
                2. The global ``buildout`` dictionary.
        
                3. A dictionary containing the current ``os.environ`` augmented with
                   the part specific overrides.
        
            The callable is not expected to return anything.
        
            .. note:: The ``os.environ`` is not modified so if the hook script is
                      interested in the environment variable overrides defined for the
                      part it needs to read them from the dictionary that is passed in
                      as the third parameter instead of accessing ``os.environ``
                      directly.
        
        ``pre-make-hook``
        
            Custom python script that will be executed before running
            ``make``. The format and semantics are the same as with the
            ``pre-configure-hook`` option.
        
        ``post-make-hook``
        
            Custom python script that will be executed after running
            ``make``. The format and semantics are the same as with the
            ``pre-configure-hook`` option.
        
        .. hook shell command:
        
        ``pre-configure``
        
            Shell command that will be executed before running ``configure``
            script. It takes the same effect as ``pre-configure-hook`` option
            except it's shell command.
        
        ``pre-build``
        
            Shell command that will be executed before running ``make``. It
            takes the same effect as ``pre-make-hook`` option except it's
            shell command.
        
        ``pre-install``
        
            Shell command that will be executed before running ``make``
            install.
        
        ``post-install``
        
            Shell command that will be executed after running ``make``. It
            takes the same effect as ``post-make-hook`` option except it's
            shell command.
        
        ``keep-compile-dir``
        
            Switch to optionally keep the temporary directory where the
            package was compiled. This is mostly useful for other recipes that
            use this recipe to compile a software but wish to do some
            additional steps not handled by this recipe. The location of the
            compile directory is stored in ``options['compile-directory']``.
            Accepted values are ``true`` or ``false``, defaults to ``false``.
        
        ``promises``
        
           List the pathes and files should be existed after install part. The
           file or path must be absolute path. One line one item
        
           If any item doesn't exist, the recipe shows a warning message. The
           default value is empty.
        
        ``environment-section``
        
            Name of a section that provides environment variables that will be used to
            augment the variables read from ``os.environ`` before executing the
            recipe.
        
            This recipe does not modify ``os.environ`` directly. External commands
            run as part of the recipe (e.g. make, configure, etc.) get an augmented
            environment when they are forked. Python hook scripts are passed the
            augmented as a parameter.
        
            The values of the environment variables may contain references to other
            existing environment variables (including themselves) in the form of
            Python string interpolation variables using the dictionary notation. These
            references will be expanded using values from ``os.environ``. This can be
            used, for example, to append to the ``PATH`` variable, e.g.::
        
                [component]
                recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
                environment-section =
                    environment
        
                [environment]
                PATH = %(PATH)s:${buildout:directory}/bin
        
        ``environment``
        
          A sequence of ``KEY=VALUE`` pairs separated by newlines that define
          additional environment variables used to update ``os.environ`` before
          executing the recipe.
        
          The semantics of this option are the same as ``environment-section``. If
          both ``environment-section`` and ``environment`` are provided the values from
          the former will be overridden by the latter allowing per-part customization.
        
        The recipe uses separated part to support custom options in different
        platforms. These platform's part has a pattern "part:platform" or
        "part:platform:arch".
        
        arch could be 'x86', 'amd64', 'ia64' ... which equals
        platform.machine().
        
        platform could be 'linux', 'cygwin', 'macos', 'sunos', 'freebsd',
        'netbsd', 'unixware' ... which equals a formatted sys.platform.
        
        For example::
        
          [bzip2]
          recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
        
          [bzip2:cygwin]
          patches = cygwin-bzip2-1.0.6.src.patch
        
        All the options in the [part:platform] have high priority level.
        
        The recipe first searches the exact match, if no found. Ignore arch
        and search again, if still found nothing. Use no platform part.
        
        Additionally, the recipe honors the ``download-cache`` option set
        in the ``[buildout]`` section and stores the downloaded files under
        it. If the value is not set a directory called ``downloads`` will be
        created in the root of the buildout and the ``download-cache``
        option set accordingly.
        
        The recipe will first check if there is a local copy of the package
        before downloading it from the net. Files can be shared among
        different buildouts by setting the ``download-cache`` to the same
        location.
        
        The recipe honors the ``prefix`` option set in the ``[buildout]``
        section either. It implicts all the parts which recipe is
        slapos.recipe.cmmi in this buildout process will be installed in the
        same ``prefix`` option in the ``[buildout]``. Besides, once it takes
        effects, recipe will return all the installed files in the prefix
        directory. The own ``prefix`` of part will disable this behaviour.
        
        If the ``buildout`` section has a valid ``prefix`` option, the recipe
        will add it to environmet variables as the following::
        
          PATH=${buildout:prefix}/bin:$PATH
          CPPFLAGS=-I${buildout:prefix} $CPPFLAGS
          CFLAGS=-I${buildout:prefix} $CFFLAGS
          CXXFLAGS=-I${buildout:prefix} $CXXFLAGS
          LDFLAGS=-L${buildout:prefix}/lib
        
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        We'll use a few tarballs to demonstrate the recipe.
        We'll modify one of them in-place but we don't want to alter the source tree.
        
            >>> import os
            >>> src = join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'testdata')
            >>> ls(src)
            - Foo-Bar-0.0.0.tar.gz
            - haproxy-1.4.8-dummy.tar.gz
            - package-0.0.0.tar.gz
            >>> package_path = join(tmpdir('testdata'), 'package-0.0.0.tar.gz')
            >>> os.symlink(join(src, 'package-0.0.0.tar.gz'), package_path)
        
        The package contains a dummy ``configure`` script that will simply
        echo the options it was called with and create a ``Makefile`` that
        will do the same.
        
        Let's create a buildout to build and install the package.
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]
            ... newest = true
            ... parts = package
            ...
            ... [package]
            ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
            ... url = file://%s
            ... """ % package_path)
        
        This will download, extract and build our demo package with the
        default build options.
        
            >>> print(system(buildout)) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
            Installing package.
            configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
            building package
            installing package
            <BLANKLINE>
        
        Check option "promises"
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]
            ... newest = false
            ... parts = packagex
            ...
            ... [packagex]
            ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
            ... url = file://%s
            ... promises = /usr/bin/myfoo
            ... """ % package_path)
        
        This will download, extract and build our demo package with the
        default build options.
        
            >>> print(system(buildout))
            Uninstalling package.
            Installing packagex.
            configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/packagex
            building package
            installing package
            packagex: could not find promise "/usr/bin/myfoo"
            <BLANKLINE>
        
        As we can see the configure script was called with the ``--prefix``
        option by default followed by calls to ``make`` and ``make install``.
        
        Installing a Perl package
        =========================
        
        The recipe can be used to install packages that use a slightly different build
        process. Perl packages often come with a ``Makefile.PL`` script that performs
        the same task as a ``configure`` script and generates a ``Makefile``.
        
        We can build and install such a package by overriding the ``configure-command``
        option. The following example builds a Foo::Bar perl module and installs it in
        a custom location within the buildout::
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """

        Installing a package without an ``autoconf`` like system
        ========================================================
        
        Some packages do not use a configuration mechanism and simply provide a
        ``Makefile`` for building. It is common in these cases that the build process
        is controlled entirely by direct options to ``make``. We can build such a
        package by faking a configure command that does nothing and passing the
        appropriate options to ``make``. The ``true`` utility found in most shell
        environments is a good candidate for this although anything that returns a
        zero exit code would do.
        
        We are using a dummy "HAProxy" package as an example of a package with only a
        Makefile and using explicit ``make`` options to control the build process.
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]

        Installing checkouts
        ====================
        
        Sometimes instead of downloading and building an existing tarball we need to
        work with code that is already available on the filesystem, for example an SVN
        checkout.
        
        Instead of providing the ``url`` option we will provide a ``path`` option to
        the directory containing the source code.
        
        Let's demonstrate this by first unpacking our test package to the filesystem
        and building that.
        
            >>> checkout_dir = tmpdir('checkout')
            >>> import setuptools.archive_util
            >>> setuptools.archive_util.unpack_archive(package_path, checkout_dir)
            >>> ls(checkout_dir)
            d package-0.0.0
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]
            ... newest = false
            ... parts = package
            ...
            ... [package]
            ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
            ... path = %s/package-0.0.0
            ... """ % checkout_dir)
        
            >>> print(system(buildout))
            Uninstalling haproxy.
            Installing package.
            package: Using local source directory: /checkout/package-0.0.0
            configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
            building package
            installing package
        
        Since using the ``path`` implies that the source code has been acquired
        outside of the control of the recipe also the responsibility of managing it is
        outside of the recipe.
        
        Depending on the software you may need to manually run ``make clean`` etc.
        between buildout runs if you make changes to the code. Also, the
        ``keep-compile-dir`` has no effect when ``path`` is used.
        
        
        Advanced configuration
        ======================
        
        The above options are enough to build most packages. However, in some cases it
        is not enough and we need to control the build process more. Let's try again
        with a new buildout and provide more options.
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]

        This configuration uses custom configure options, an environment section,
        per-part customization to the environment, custom prefix, multiple make
        targets and also patches the source code before the scripts are run.

        Customizing the build process
        =============================
        
        Sometimes even the above is not enough and you need to be able to control the
        process in even more detail. One such use case would be to perform dynamic
        substitutions on the source code (possible based on information from the
        buildout) which cannot be done with static patches or to simply run arbitrary
        commands.
        
        The recipe allows you to write custom python scripts that hook into the build
        process. You can define a script to be run:
        
         - before the configure script is executed (pre-configure-hook)
         - before the make process is executed (pre-make-hook)
         - after the make process is finished (post-make-hook)
        
        Each option needs to contain the following information
        
          /full/path/to/the/python/module.py:name_of_callable
        
        where the callable object (here name_of_callable) is expected to take three
        parameters:
        
            1. The ``options`` dictionary from the recipe.
        
            2. The global ``buildout`` dictionary.
        
            3. A dictionary containing the current ``os.environ`` augmented with
               the part specific overrides.
        
        These parameters should provide the callable all the necessary information to
        perform any part specific customization to the build process.
        
        Let's create a simple python script to demonstrate the functionality. You can
        naturally have separate modules for each hook or simply use just one or two
        hooks. Here we use just a single module.
        
            >>> hooks = tmpdir('hooks')
            >>> write(hooks, 'customhandlers.py',
            ... """
            ... import logging
            ... log = logging.getLogger('hook')

            ...     log.info('This is pre-configure-hook!')
            ...
            ... def premake(options, buildout, environment):
            ...     log.info('This is pre-make-hook!')
            ...
            ... def postmake(options, buildout, environment):
            ...     log.info('This is post-make-hook!')

            ... """)
        
        and a new buildout to try it out

        This will run pre-configure, pre-build, pre-install, post-install as

        Building in multi-platforms
        ===========================
        
        The recipe can specify build options for each platform. For example,
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]
            ... newest = false
            ... parts = package
            ...
            ... [package]
            ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
            ... url = file://%s
            ... pre-configure = echo "Configure in common platform"
            ... post-install = echo "Finished."
            ...
            ... [package:cygwin]
            ... pre-configure = echo "Configure in the CYGWIN platform"
            ... pre-install = echo "Installing in the CYGWIN"
            ... post-install = echo -n "CYGWIN " && ${package:post-install}
            ... """ % package_path)
        
        In the linux, the recipe gets the options from part 'package', there
        are only ``pre-configure`` and ``post-install``. the output will be
        
            #>>> print(system(buildout))
            Uninstalling package.
            Installing package.
            package: Executing pre-configure
            Configure part: Configure in common platform
            configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
            building package
            installing package
            package: Executing post-install
            Finished.
        
        In the cygwin, the recipe merges the options in the parts 'package'
        and 'package:cygwin'.
        
        Union prefix
        ============
        
        If the recipe finds ``prefix`` option in the section buildout, it will
        
          * First, use this ``prefix`` as configure prefix, if
            ``configure-command`` isn't set in the part, or ``make-binary``
            equals 'make' and ``make-target`` includes pattern '\s+install.*'
        
          * Second, return all the new installed files in the prefix when the
            recipe returns after intall.
        
          * Finally, change some environment variables(See first section).
        
        Let's see what happens when set prefix in the buildout section:
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]
            ... newest = false
            ... parts = package
            ... prefix = ${buildout:directory}/mylocal
            ...
            ... [package]
            ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
            ... url = file://%s
            ... pre-configure = mkdir -p "${buildout:prefix}"
            ... """ % package_path)

            package: Executing pre-configure
            configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/mylocal

            installing package
            <BLANKLINE>
        
        Look these environment variables and prefix's value, you know what's
        the differences.
        
        If part has its own ``prefix``, it will disable above behavious. For
        example,
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]

            ... url = file://%s
            ... pre-configure = rm -rf "${buildout:prefix}"
            ... post-install = test -d "${buildout:prefix}" || echo "None"
            ... """ % package_path)
        
            >>> print(system(buildout))

            installing package
            package: Executing post-install
            None
        
        Then no extra environment variables such as CFLAGS etc., and no
        ${buildout:prefix} directory is created.
        
        The following example shows how to install package, package-2 in one

        Magic prefix
        ============
        
        If configure-command is set, the recipe wouldn't insert "--prefix"
        into configure-options. Then it checks whether both of make-binary and
        make-targets aren't set, if so, string "prefix=xxx" will be appended
        in the make-targets. xxx is the final prefix of this recipe. We call
        it Magic Prefix.
        
        In these options magic prefix can be represented by ``%(prefix)s``:
        
            ``configure-command``, ``configure-options``,
            ``make-binary``, ``make-options``, ``make-targets``,
            ``pre-configure``, ``pre-build``, ``pre-install``, ``post-install``
        
        For example::
        
          [bzip2]
          post-install = rm %(prefix)s/*.h
        
        The other part can refer to magic prefix of this part by
        ${part:prefix}, it will return the magic prefix, other than literal
        value in the part section. For example::
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]
            ... newest = false
            ... parts = package package-2
            ... prefix = /mytemp
            ...
            ... [package]
            ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
            ... url = file://%s
            ... configure-command = true
            ... make-binary = true
            ...
            ... [package-2]
            ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
            ... url = file://%s
            ... configure-command = true
            ... make-binary = true
            ... post-install = echo package magic prefix is ${package:prefix}
            ... """ % (package_path, package_path))
        
            >>> print(system(buildout))

        Here it's another sample, we change Makefile before installing so it
        can display "prefix" value in the stdout.
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',

            ...     ('chmod', '-R', 'u+w', shared_dir, another_shared_dir)))
        
        If no ``shared-part-list`` is set, and ``shared`` is True, ``shared`` feature
        is not used.
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """

        If ``shared-part-list`` is set and shared is True, build package failed, the
        build directory is removed, a build directory__compile__ is left for
        debugging.
        Also a shell script with the environment variable is created, so that
        developer can try same build process as the recipe tried.

        But we had a bug with version v0.11 is that if build was interrupted in the middle of the build of a
        shared part. The shared part was left in an inconsistent state that looked like installation succeeded.
        
        Let's simulate a scenario where buildout is terminated in the middle of a build.
        For this, we need a package that takes a lot of time to install.
        
            >>> with tarfile.open(package_path, 'w:gz') as tar:
            ...   configure = b'#!/bin/sh\necho configure started\nsleep 300;'
            ...   info = tarfile.TarInfo('configure')
            ...   info.size = len(configure)
            ...   info.mode = 0o755
            ...   tar.addfile(info, BytesIO(configure))
        
        We also need a bit more complex method to run buildout so that we send a termination signal in the
        middle of build process.
        
            >>> import signal
            >>> import time
            >>> buildout_process = subprocess.Popen(buildout, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
            >>> output_line = ''
            >>> for _ in range(10):
            ...   time.sleep(1)
            ...   output_line = buildout_process.stdout.readline()
            ...   if output_line and b'configure started' in output_line:
            ...     print ('configure started')
            ...     buildout_process.send_signal(signal.SIGKILL)
            ...     print ('buildout terminated')
            ...     break
            configure started
            buildout terminated
            >>> _ = buildout_process.wait()
        
        
        If we run buildout again, the compile dir is removed again and installation is retried. This time
        installation can succeed.
        
        This was not the case in version 0.11 of this recipe. If installation of a shared part failed, this was
        not detected and the part was considered as installed.
        
        
            >>> os.rename(package_path + '.bak', package_path)
            >>> print(system(buildout)) #doctest:+ELLIPSIS

        If ``shared-part-list`` is set as an option in buildout section and
        ``shared`` is True, package will be installed in shared_part/package
        and a hash of the recipe's configuration options.
        
        There can be multiple path listed in ``shared-part-list``, the recipe
        will look in each of these paths if package was already installed and
        if not, it will install the package in the last entry the last entry
        from the list of ``shared-part-list``.
        
        If package was already installed in any of the ``shared-part-list`` used, it will be
        used instead of installing if one package has been installed.

        For even more specific needs you can write your own recipe that uses
        ``slapos.recipe.cmmi`` and set the ``keep-compile-dir`` option to ``true``.
        You can then continue from where this recipe finished by reading the location
        of the compile directory from ``options['compile-directory']`` from your own
        recipe.
