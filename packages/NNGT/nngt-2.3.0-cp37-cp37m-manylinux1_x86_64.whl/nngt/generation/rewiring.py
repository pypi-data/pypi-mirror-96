    r'''
    Build a (generally irregular) lattice by rewiring the edges of a graph.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    The lattice is based on a circular graph, meaning that the nodes are placed
    on a circle and connected based on the topological distance between them,
    the distance being defined through the positive modulo:

    .. math::

        d_{ij} = (i - j) \% N

    with :math:`N` the number of nodes in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    g : :class:`~nngt.Graph`
        Graph based on which the lattice will be generated.
    target_reciprocity : float, optional (default: 1.)
        Value of reciprocity that should be aimed at. Depending on the number
        of edges, it may not be possible to reach this value exactly.
    node_attr_constraints : str, optional (default: randomize all attributes)
        Whether attribute randomization is constrained: either "preserve",
        where all nodes keep their attributes, or "together", where attributes
        are randomized by groups (all attributes of a given node are sent to
        the same new node). By default, attributes are completely and
        separately randomized.
    edge_attr_constraints : str, optional (default: randomize all but `weight`)
        Whether attribute randomization is constrained.
        If "distance" is used, then all number attributes (float or int) are
        sorted and are first associated to the shortest or longest edges
        depending on the value of `distance_sort`. Note that, for directed
        graphs, if a reciprocal edge exists, it is immediately assigned the
        next highest (respectively lowest) attribute after that of its directed
        couterpart.
        If "together" is used, edges attributes are randomized by groups (all
        attributes of a given edge are sent to the same new edge) either
        randomly if `weight` is None, or following the constrained `weight`
        attribute. By default, attributes are completely and separately
        randomized (except for `weight` if it has been provided).
    weight : str, optional (default: None)
        Whether a specific edge attribute should play the role of weight and
        have special constraints.
    weight_constraint : str, optional (default: "distance")
        Same as `edge_attr_constraints`` but only applies to `weight` and can
        only be "distance" or None since "together" was related to `weight`.
    distance_sort : str, optional (default: "inverse")
        How attributes are sorted with edge distance: either "inverse", with
        the shortest edges being assigned the largest weights, or with a
        "linear" sort, where shortest edges are assigned the lowest weights.

    Generate a new rewired graph from `g`.

    ----------
    g : :class:`~nngt.Graph`
        Base graph based on which a new rewired graph will be generated.
    constraints : str, optional (default: no constraints)
        Defines which properties of `g` will be maintained in the rewired
        graph. By default, the graph is completely rewired into an Erdos-Renyi
        model. Available constraints are "in-degree", "out-degree",
        "total-degree", "all-degrees", and "clustering".
    node_attr_constraints : str, optional (default: randomize all attributes)
        Whether attribute randomization is constrained: either "preserve",
        where all nodes keep their attributes, or "together", where attributes
        are randomized by groups (all attributes of a given node are sent to

        separately randomized.
    edge_attr_constraints : str, optional (default: randomize all attributes)
        Whether attribute randomization is constrained.
        If `constraints` is "in-degree" (respectively "out-degree") or
        "degrees", this can be "preserve_in" (respectively "preserve_out"),
        in which case all attributes of a given edge are moved together to a
        new incoming (respectively outgoing) edge of the same node.
        Regardless of `constraints`, "together" can be used so that edges
        attributes are randomized by groups (all attributes of a given edge are
        sent to the same new edge). By default, attributes are completely and
        separately randomized.
