# pVACapi

pVACapi is a web server providing a REST application programming interface (API). With this API, one may issue commands to pVACtools to launch processes, manage running processes, and review data produced by completed processes. It also provides a scatterplot visualization for final results.

The API is primarily intended to drive the pVACviz browser application, which uses the REST endpoints to provide a easy-to-use interface to pVACtools.
