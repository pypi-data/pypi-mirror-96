django-treebeard
================

`django-treebeard <https://tabo.pe/projects/django-treebeard/>`_
is a library that implements efficient tree implementations for the
`Django Web Framework 1.8+ <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, written by
`Gustavo Pic√≥n <https://tabo.pe>`_ and licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

``django-treebeard`` is:

- **Flexible**: Includes 3 different tree implementations with the same API:

  1. :doc:`Adjacency List <al_tree>`
  2. :doc:`Materialized Path <mp_tree>`
  3. :doc:`Nested Sets <ns_tree>`

- **Fast**: Optimized non-naive tree operations
- **Easy**: Uses Django's
  :ref:`model-inheritance` with :ref:`abstract-base-classes`.
  to define your own models.
- **Clean**: Testable and well tested code base. Code/branch test coverage
  is above 96%.
