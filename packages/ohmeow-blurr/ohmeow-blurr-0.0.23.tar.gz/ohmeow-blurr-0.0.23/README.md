# blurr
> A library that integrates huggingface transformers with version 2 of the fastai framework


## Install

You can now pip install blurr via `pip install ohmeow-blurr`

Or, even better as this library is under *very* active development, create an editable install like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/ohmeow/blurr.git
cd blurr
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## How to use

The initial release includes everything you need for sequence classification and question answering tasks.  Support for token classification and summarization are incoming. Please check the documentation for more thorough examples of how to use this package.

The following two packages need to be installed for blurr to work:
1. fastai2 (see http://docs.fast.ai/ for installation instructions)
2. huggingface transformers (see https://huggingface.co/transformers/installation.html for details)

## ❗ Updates

**12/31/2020**

***The "Goodbye 2020" release with lots of goodies for blurr users:***
* Updated the Seq2Seq models to use some of the latest huggingface bits like `tokenizer.prepare_seq2seq_batch`.
* Separated out the Seq2Seq and Token Classification metrics into metrics-specific callbacks for a better separation of concerns. As a best practice, you should now *only* use them as `fit_one_cycle`, etc.. callbacks rather than attach them to your `Learner`.
* **NEW**: Translation are now available in blurr, joining causal language modeling and summarization in our core Seq2Seq stack
* **NEW**: Integration of huggingface's Seq2Seq metrics (rouge, bertscore, meteor, bleu, and sacrebleu). Plenty of info on how to set this up in the docs.
* **NEW**: Added `default_text_gen_kwargs`, a method that given a huggingface config, model, and task (optional), will return the default/recommended kwargs for any text generation models.
* A lot of code cleanup (e.g., refactored naming and removal of redundant code into classes/methods)
* **More model support** and **more tests** across the board!  Check out the docs for more info
* Misc. validation improvements and bug fixes.

As I'm sure there is plenty I can do to make this library better, please don't hesitate to join in and help the effort by submitting PRs, pointing out problems with my code, or letting me know what and how I can improve things generally. Some models, like mbart and mt5 for example, aren't giving good results and I'd love to get any and all feedback from the community on how to resolve such issues ... so hit me up, I promise I won't bit :)

**12/20/2020** 
* Updated `Learner.blurr_predict` and `Learner.blurr_predict_tokens` to support single or multiple items
* Added ONNX support for sequence classification, token classification, and question/answering tasks. `blurrONNX` provides ONNX friendly variants of `Learner.blurr_predict` and `Learner.blurr_predict_tokens` in the form of `blurrONNX.predict` and `blurrONNX.predict_tokens` respectively.  Like their Learner equivalents, these methods support single or multiple items for inferece.  See the docs/code for examples and speed gains you get with ONNX.
* Added quantization support when converting your blurr models to ONNX.
* Requires fast.ai >= 2.1.5 and huggingface transformers >= 4.x

**12/12/2020** 
* Updated to work with the latest version of fast.ai (2.1.8) and huggingface transformers >= 4.x
* Fixed `Learner.blurr_summary` to work with fast.ai >= 2.1.8
* Fixed inclusion of `add_prefix_space` in tokenizer `BLURR_MODEL_HELPER`
* Fixed token classification `show_results` for tokenizers that add a prefix space
* Notebooks run with environment variable "TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false" to avoid fast tokenizer warnings
* Updated docs

**11/12/2020** 
* Updated documentation
* Updated model callbacks to support mixed precision training regardless of whether you are calculating the loss yourself or letting huggingface do it for you.

**11/10/2020** 
* Major update just about everywhere to facilitate a breaking change in fastai's treatment of `before_batch` transforms.
* Reorganized code as I being to work on LM and other text2text tasks
* Misc. fixes

**10/08/2020** 
* Updated all models to use [ModelOutput](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/output.html) classes instead of traditional tuples. `ModelOutput` attributes are assigned to the appropriate fastai bits like `Learner.pred` and `Learner.loss` and anything else you've requested the huggingface model to return is available via the `Learner.blurr_model_outputs` dictionary (see next two bullet items)
* Added ability to grab attentions and hidden state from `Learner`. You can get at them via `Learner.blurr_model_outputs` dictionary if you tell `HF_BaseModelWrapper` to provide them.
* Added `model_kwargs` to `HF_BaseModelWrapper` should you need to request a huggingface model to return something specific to it's type. These outputs will be available via the `Learner.blurr_model_outputs` dictionary as well.

**09/16/2020** 
* Major overhaul to do *everything* at batch time (including tokenization/numericalization). If this backfires, I'll roll everything back but as of now, I think this approach not only meshes better with how huggingface tokenization works and reduce RAM utilization for big datasets, but also opens up opportunities for incorporating augmentation, building adversarial models, etc....  Thoughts?
* Added tests for summarization bits
* New change may require some small modifications (see docs or ask on issues thread if you have problems you can't fiture out).  I'm NOT doing a release until pypi until folks have a chance to work with the latest.

**09/07/2020** 
* Added tests for question/answer and summarization transformer models
* Updated summarization to support BART, T5, and Pegasus

**08/20/2020** 
* Updated everything to work latest version of fastai (tested against 2.0.0)
* Added batch-time padding, so that by default now, `HF_TokenizerTransform` doesn't add any padding tokens and all huggingface inputs are padded simply to the max sequence length in each batch rather than to the max length (passed in and/or acceptable to the model).  This should create efficiencies across the board, from memory consumption to GPU utilization.  The old tried and true method of padding during tokenization requires you to pass in `padding='max_length` to `HF_TextBlock`.
* Removed code to remove fastai2 @patched summary methods which had previously conflicted with a couple of the huggingface transformers

**08/13/2020** 
* Updated everything to work latest transformers and fastai
* Reorganized code to bring it more inline with how huggingface separates out their "tasks".

**07/06/2020** 
* Updated everything to work huggingface>=3.02
* Changed a lot of the internals to make everything more efficient and performant along with the latest version of huggingface ... meaning, I have broken things for folks using previous versions of blurr :).

**06/27/2020** 
* Simplified the `BLURR_MODEL_HELPER.get_hf_objects` method to support a wide range of options in terms of building the necessary huggingface objects (architecture, config, tokenizer, and model).  Also added `cache_dir` for saving pre-trained objects in a custom directory.
* Misc. renaming and cleanup that may break existing code (please see the docs/source if things blow up)
* Added missing required libraries to requirements.txt (e.g., nlp)

**05/23/2020** 
* Initial support for text generation (e.g., summarization, conversational agents) models now included. Only tested with BART so if you try it with other models before I do, lmk what works ... and what doesn't

**05/17/2020** 
* Major code restructuring to make it easier to build out the library.
* `HF_TokenizerTransform` replaces `HF_Tokenizer`, handling the tokenization and numericalization in one place.  DataBlock code has been dramatically simplified.
* Tokenization correctly handles huggingface tokenizers that require `add_prefix_space=True`.
* `HF_BaseModelCallback` and `HF_BaseModelCallback` are required and work together in order to allow developers to tie into any callback friendly event exposed by fastai2 and also pass in named arguments to the huggingface models.
* `show_batch` and `show_results` have been updated for Question/Answer and Token Classification models to represent the data and results in a more easily intepretable manner than the defaults.

**05/06/2020** 
* Initial support for Token classification (e.g., NER) models now included
* Extended fastai's `Learner` object with a `predict_tokens` method used specifically in token classification
* `HF_BaseModelCallback` can be used (or extended) instead of the model wrapper to ensure your inputs into the huggingface model is correct (recommended). See docs for examples (and thanks to fastai's Sylvain for the suggestion!)
* `HF_Tokenizer` can work with strings or a string representation of a list (the later helpful for token classification tasks)
* `show_batch` and `show_results` methods have been updated to allow better control on how huggingface tokenized data is represented in those methods
