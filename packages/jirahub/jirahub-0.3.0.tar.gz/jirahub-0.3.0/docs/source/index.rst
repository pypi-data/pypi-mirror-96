Jirahub provides a configurable tool for synchronization of issues between a
GitHub repository and a JIRA project.  With it, you can use GitHub for coding
and ticket tracking while using JIRA for ticket tracking and project management.

Download and install
====================

To download and install:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install jirahub

The package's sole requirements are `PyGithub <https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub>`_ and
`JIRA <https://github.com/pycontribs/jira>`_.  Both of these dependencies are installable via pip.

JIRA configuration
==================

jirahub stores state on the JIRA issue in two custom fields, which you (or your JIRA administrator)
will need to create.  The first field stores the URL of a linked GitHub issue, and should be
type "URL Field".  The second stores a JSON object containing general jirahub metadata, and should
be type "Text field (multi-line)".

jirahub configuration
=====================

Jirahub configuration is divided between environment variables (JIRA and GitHub credentials)
and one or more .py files (all other parameters).

Environment variables
---------------------

Your JIRA and GitHub credentials are provided to jirahub via environment variables:

=====================  ===================================================================================================================================
Variable name          Description
=====================  ===================================================================================================================================
JIRAHUB_JIRA_USERNAME  JIRA username of your jirahub bot
JIRAHUB_JIRA_PASSWORD  JIRA password of your jirahub bot
JIRAHUB_GITHUB_TOKEN   GitHub `API token <https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line>`_ of your jirahub bot
=====================  ===================================================================================================================================

Configuration file
------------------

The remaining parameters are specified in a Python configuration file.  There are few required
parameters, but jirahub takes no actions by default, so users must explicitly enable features that
they wish to use.  The `generate-config`_ command can be used to create an initial configuration file.
The file is executed with the ``c`` variable bound to an instance of ``jirahub.config.JirahubConfig``,
which has two attributes, ``jira`` and ``github``.

jira
````

These are parameters particular to JIRA.  The ``server`` and ``project_key`` attributes are required.

Multiple configuration files
````````````````````````````

To facilitate re-use of common parameters, jirahub commands will accept multiple
configuration file paths.

Command-line interface
======================

Jirahub is controlled with the ``jirahub`` command.  There are three subcommands: ``generate-config``,
``check-permissions``, and ``sync``.

generate-config
---------------

The ``generate-config`` command will print a template jirahub configuration file to stdout:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jirahub generate-config > my-jirahub-config.py

check-permissions
-----------------

Once you're satisfied with your configuration file, you can submit it to the ``check-permissions``
command for verification.  Jirahub will attempt to connect to your JIRA server and GitHub
repository and report any failures.  It will also list any missing permissions from JIRA or GitHub
that are required for the features selected in the configuration file.  A successful check looks
like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jirahub check-permissions my-jirahub-config.py
    JIRA and GitHub permissions are sufficient

And an unsuccessful check:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jirahub check-permissions my-jirahub-config.py
    JIRA and/or GitHub permissions must be corrected:
    sync_comments is enabled, but JIRA user has not been granted the DELETE_OWN_COMMENTS permission.
    sync_status is enabled, but JIRA user has not been granted the CLOSE_ISSUES permission.
    GitHub rejected credentials.  Check JIRAHUB_GITHUB_TOKEN and try again.

sync
----

The ``sync`` command does the work of syncing issues and comments.  At minimum, you must
specify a configuration file.  Additional options include:

* **--min-updated-at**: Restrict jirahub's activity to issues updated after this timestamp.  The timestamp
  format is ISO-8601 in UTC with no timezone suffix (e.g., 1983-11-20T11:00:00).

* **--state-path**: Path to a JSON file containing the same timestamp described above, as well as
  a list of issues that failed.  The file will be updated after each run.

* **--dry-run**: Query issues and report changes to the (verbose) log, but do not change any data.

* **--verbose**: Enable verbose logging

Jirahub sync as a cron job
``````````````````````````

Users will likely want to run ``jirahub sync`` in a cron job, so that it can regularly poll JIRA/GitHub
for changes.  We recommend use of the `lockrun <http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/lockrun.html>`_ tool to
avoid overlap between jirahub processes.  Your cron line might look something like this::

    */5 * * * * lockrun --lockfile=/path/to/jirahub.lockrun -- jirahub sync /path/to/my-jirahub-config.py --state-path /path/to/jirahub-state.json >> /path/to/jirahub.log 2>&1

Custom formatters
=================

The ``issue_title_formatter``, ``issue_body_formatter``, and ``comment_body_formatter`` parameters allow you to customize
how the issue and comment text fields are written to the linked issue.  The issue formatters are callables that receive
two arguments, the original ``jirahub.entities.Issue`` that is being synced, and the title/body string.  The title/body
has already been modified by jirahub; it has been redacted, if that feature is enabled, and the formatting has been
transformed to suit the target service.  The following formatter adds a "JIRAHUB: " prefix to JIRA issue titles:

.. code-block:: python

   def custom_formatter(issue, title):
     return "JIRAHUB: " + title

   c.jira.issue_title_formatter = custom_formatter

The original issue title/body (without jirahub's modifications) is available from the issue object:

.. code-block:: python

   def custom_formatter(issue, body):
     return "This is the original body: " + issue.body

   c.jira.issue_body_formatter = custom_formatter

If you need access to a custom field that isn't recognized by jirahub, that is available via the ``raw_issue``,
which contains the ``jira.resources.Issue`` or ``github.Issue`` that was used to construct the jirahub Issue.

.. code-block:: python

   def custom_formatter(issue, body):
     return "This is some custom field value: " + issue.raw_issue.body

   c.jira.issue_body_formatter = custom_formatter

The ``comment_body_formatter`` is similar, except that it receives three arguments, the original ``jirahub.entities.Issue``,
the ``jirahub.entities.Comment``, and the comment body.

.. code-block:: python

   def custom_formatter(issue, comment, body):
     return "Check out this great comment from GitHub: " + body

   c.jira.comment_body_formatter = custom_formatter

The unmodified comment body is available from ``comment.body``, and the JIRA/GitHub comment object
from ``comment.raw_comment``.

Issue filters
=============

The ``issue_filter`` parameter allows you to select issues that will be created in the target
service.  The filter is a callable that receives a single argument, the original
``jirahub.entities.Issue`` that is a candidate for sync, and returns True to create it, or False
to ignore it.  For example, this filter only syncs issues with a certain label:

.. code-block:: python

  def issue_filter(issue):
    return "sync-me" in issue.labels

  c.jira.issue_filter = issue_filter

This feature can be used to sync issues based on "commands" issued by commenters:

.. code-block:: python

  ADMINISTRATOR_USERNAMES = {
    "linda",
    "frank"
  }

  def issue_filter(issue):
    return any(c for c in issue.comments if c.user.username in ADMINISTRATOR_USERNAMES and "SYNC ME PLEASE" in c.body)

  c.jira.issue_filter = issue_filter

Issue hooks
===========

The ``before_issue_create`` and ``before_issue_update`` hooks allow you to transform the fields sent
to JIRA/GitHub when an issue is created.  They can override jirahub's behavior, or set custom fields
that aren't otherwise managed by jirahub.

The create hooks are callables that receive 2 required arguments: the original ``jirahub.entities.Issue``,
and a ``dict`` of fields that will be used to create the issue.  The 3rd optional argument, if present,
will receive the the ``jirahub.IssueSync`` instance.  Each callable must return a ``dict`` containing
the transformed fields.

The update hooks are callables that receive 4 required arguments: the updated ``jirahub.entities.Issue``,
a ``dict`` of fields that will be used to modify that issue, the corresponding linked ``jirahub.entities.Issue``,
and another ``dict`` of fields.  The 5th optional argument, if present, will receive the ``jirahub.IssueSync``
instance.  Each callable must return two ``dict`` instances containing the transformed fields.

For example, this create hook sets a custom JIRA field:

.. code-block:: python

  def hook(issue, fields):
    fields["custom_jira_field"] = "some custom value"
    return fields

  c.jira.before_issue_create.append(hook)

Manually linking issues
=======================

It is possible to link existing GitHub and JIRA issues by hand by setting the GitHub issue URL field
in JIRA.  jirahub will begin syncing the two issues on next run.  Take care that you don't link two
JIRA issues to the same GitHub issue, that way lies peril (undefined behavior).
