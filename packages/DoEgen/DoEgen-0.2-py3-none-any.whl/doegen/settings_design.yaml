# Set maximum time for optimization per run (in seconds; recommended to set to at least ~100s)

# Set maximal stepsize of run size interval, so tyhat noty each runszie has teo be optimized
# The larger the interval, the faster the  total computation
# by default (select delta_nrun = None) it will select automatically the interval step with the lowest common multiple of the levels 
# (e.g. if mix between level 2 and 3 thus will results in delta_nrun = 6)
