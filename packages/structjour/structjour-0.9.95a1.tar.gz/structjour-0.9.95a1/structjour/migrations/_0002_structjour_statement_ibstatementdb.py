Add RealRR to the trade_sums table.

In prepartion to being django model. Figure out what will need to be done. The important part is to
provide an update path for model changes without breaking anything. Currently its specific to structjour
and sqlite but will evantually adopt django models and we will do less locally. Until the transition, it
will get a bit messy.
