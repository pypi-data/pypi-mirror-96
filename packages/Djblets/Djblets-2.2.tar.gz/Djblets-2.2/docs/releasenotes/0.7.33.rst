Security Updates
================

* Fixed a Self-XSS vulnerability in the :py:class:`djblets.datagrid` column
  headers.

  A recently-discovered vulnerability in the datagrid templates allows an
  attacker to generate a URL to any datagrid page containing malicious code in
  a column sorting value. If the user visits that URL and then clicks that
  column, the code will execute.

  The cause of the vulnerability was due to a template not escaping
  user-provided values.

  This vulnerability was reported by Jose Carlos Exposito Bueno (0xlabs).
