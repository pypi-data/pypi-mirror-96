============================
Djblets 0.7.30 Release Notes
============================

**Release date**: June 6, 2014


Security
========

* Fixed a XSS issue in the gravatars code.

  Users could construct a name that would allow for injecting
  JavaScript in the page. That name is now properly escaped.

  This is :cve:`2014-3995`.

* Fixed a XSS issue in :py:func:`json_dumps.`

  JSON payloads constructed based on user input and then injected into
  a page could result in custom JavaScript being injected into the
  page. Additional escaping is now performed to ensure this does not
  happen.

  This is :cve:`2014-3994` (discovered by "uchida", :bug:`3406`).
