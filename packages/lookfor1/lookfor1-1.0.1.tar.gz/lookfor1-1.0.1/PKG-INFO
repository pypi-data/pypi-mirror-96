Description: # lookfor
        
        ```lookfor``` is a simple command line tool to find things: files, directories, and files by extension. `lookfor` consists of only two commands (besides `--version` and `--help`), and aims to replace two Unix commands by being simpler to use and return results faster.
        
        ### Installation
        
        `pip install lf-lookfor`
        
        
        ### Usage
        
        `lf <flag> <file/ext>`
        
        #### Commands:
        ```
        --file, -f file/dir          searches for file/dir and prints all paths. Starts in cwd.
        --ext, -e extension          searches for extension and prints all paths. Starts in cwd.
        --version, -V                prints version info.
        --help, -h                   prints usage
        ```
