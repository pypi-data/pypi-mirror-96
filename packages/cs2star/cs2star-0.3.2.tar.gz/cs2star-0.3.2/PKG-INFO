Description: # cs2star.py
        
        A simple utility that wraps around `csparc2star.py` to convert particle positions from Cryosparc JOB directories into a RELION-ready directory. On top of what `csparc2star.py` already does, this script automatically symlinks (or copies) the `.mrc` files, renaming them as appropriate to `mrcs` and updating the `rlnMicrographName` column to reflect the change.
