Description: # pmv-comfort-map
        
        PMV thermal comfort map recipe for Pollination.
        
        Compute spatially-resolved operative temperature and PMV thermal comfort from
        a Honeybee model and EPW. This recipe can also (optionally) compute Standard
        Effective Temperature (SET).
        
        This recipe uses EnergyPlus to obtain longwave radiant temperatures and indoor air
        temperatures. The outdoor air temperature and air speed are taken directly from the EPW.
        A Radiance-based enhanced 2-phase method is used for all shortwave MRT calculations,
        which includes an accurate direct sun calculation using precise solar positions. The
        energy properties of the model geometry are what determine the outcome of the
        simulation and the model's SensorGrids are what determine where the comfort
        mapping occurs.
