General
========
`HydroGen` is a hydrograph generator, i.e. a tool for the stochastic generation of domestic water consumption events. Domestic water events are generated as rectangular pulses according to user-provided probability distributions and consumption data. This package was developed in parallel with the WaterHub Modelica package (see project WaterHub_ for more information).

`HydroGen` is still under heavy development.
