Description: # aiodtnsim
        
        A minimal framework for performing DTN simulations based on Python 3.7 and asyncio.
        
        Note that this project is still a **work in progress**.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * Python 3.7+
        * NumPy
        * tqdm for the progress bars
        * [dtn-tvg-util](https://gitlab.com/d3tn/dtn-tvg-util)
        * for uPCN integration, [uPCN](https://upcn.eu) v0.7.0+ with the `pyupcn` module installed in the Python environment
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Just install `aiodtnsim` via `pip`, e.g., in a virtual environment:
        
        ```
        pip install aiodtnsim
        ```
        
        For generating satellite scenarios (needed by the example script), you need to install the `dtn-tvg-util` Ring Road dependencies additionally:
        
        ```
        pip install "dtn-tvg-util[ring_road]"
        ```
        
        Now, you should be able to use the example scripts provided in the root directory of `aiodtnsim` to perform simple simulation runs, e.g. via:
        
        ```
        bash examples/example_test_run.sh
        ```
        
        ## Development Setup
        
        First, clone the `aiodtnsim`, `dtn-tvg-util`, and `upcn` repositories (the latter only for using uPCN emulation) and change into the `aiodtnsim` directory.
        Now, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
        
        ```
        python3 -m venv --without-pip .venv
        curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | .venv/bin/python
        source .venv/bin/activate
        pip install -e .
        pip install -e "../dtn-tvg-util[ring_road,gs_placement]"
        pip install -U -r ../upcn/pyupcn/requirements.txt
        python ../upcn/pyupcn/install.py
        ```
        
        If you want to perform a run with uPCN, ensure the latest binary has been built:
        
        ```
        cd ../upcn
        make
        ```
