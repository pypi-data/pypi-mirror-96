# Giant Redirect Import

A re-usable package which can be used in any project that requires a Redirect import via a CSV file.

This will include a basic form to upload a CSV file in the standard `Redirect` app supplied via django.

## Installation

To install with the package manager, run:

    $ poetry add giant-redirect-import

You should then add `"giant-redirect-import"` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in your settings file, this MUST be above `django.contrib.redirects`.

In `base.py` there should also be a `REDIRECT_IMPORT_DEFAULT_SITE_ID`.


## Configuration

This application exposes the following settings:

- `REDIRECT_IMPORT_DEFAULT_SITE_ID` is the default site id used when importing and creating the redirects, this is usually the same as the SITE_ID.
 ## Preparing for release
 
 In order to prep the package for a new release on TestPyPi and PyPi there is one key thing that you need to do. You need to update the version number in the `pyproject.toml`.
 This is so that the package can be published without running into version number conflicts. The version numbering must also follow the Semantic Version rules which can be found here https://semver.org/.
 
 ## Publishing
 
 Publishing a package with poetry is incredibly easy. Once you have checked that the version number has been updated (not the same as a previous version) then you only need to run two commands.
 
    $ `poetry build` 

will package the project up for you into a way that can be published.
 
    $ `poetry publish`

will publish the package to PyPi. You will need to enter the username and password for the account which can be found in the company password manager
