Installation
-------------

The ``Obj.MPP`` project is published on the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org>`_ at: `https://pypi.org/project/obj.mpp <https://pypi.org/project/obj.mpp>`_. It requires version 3.8, or newer, of the interpreter. It should be installable from Python distribution platforms or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Otherwise, it can be installed from a command-line console:

- For all users, after acquiring administrative rights:
    - First installation: ``pip3 install obj.mpp``
    - Installation update: ``pip3 install --upgrade obj.mpp``
- For the current user (no administrative rights required):
    - First installation: ``pip3 install --user obj.mpp``
    - Installation update: ``pip3 install --user --upgrade obj.mpp``


.. note::
    The command ``pip3`` was mentioned above to emphasize that ``Obj.MPP`` requires major version 3 of Python. If ``pip`` defaults to this version, it can of course be used instead.

The Obj.MPP documentation is hosted at `edebreuv.gitlabpages.inria.fr/Obj.MPP <https://edebreuv.gitlabpages.inria.fr/Obj.MPP>`_.
