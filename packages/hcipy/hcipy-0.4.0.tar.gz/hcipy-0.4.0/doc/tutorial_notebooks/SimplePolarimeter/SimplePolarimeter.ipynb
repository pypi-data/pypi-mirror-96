    "# Simple polarimeter\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simulate a simple polarimeter that measures linear polarization states. In this example we will use this polarimeter to measure the polarization state of starlight. \n",
    "\n",
    "In optical and near-infrared wavelengths it is with the current technology not possible to directly measure the electric field of starlight, only its intensity. Therefore, it is also not possible to directly measure its polarization state. However, this is a property of light that we would like to measure as it can contain important astrophysical information, e.g. on dust grain sizes and magnetic fields. To measure the polarization state we will have to encode this information into intensity measurements that, in post-processing, can be combined into an estimate of the polarization state. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the reader is familiar with basic polarization concepts, i.e. Stokes vectors, Mueller matrices, waveplates and polarizers. A good introduction on polarimetry can be found in Snik, F., & Keller, C. U. (2013). Astronomical polarimetry: polarized views of stars and planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use polarization optics that modulate in time to get us intensity measurements that contain polarization information. We will use a static linear polarizer, an component that only transmits one linear polarization state (e.g. horizontal polarized light), as analyzer. Before the polarizer we will put a half-wave plate (HWP). The HWP will rotate and act as the polarization modulator, which means that it transforms the linear polarization states (horizontal, vertical, +45 degree and -45 degrees) to the polarization state transmitted by the polarizer. To do so, the HWP will cycle between 0, 45, 22.5 and 67.5 degrees of rotation. For every HWP position we will measure the intensity. We can put these four intensity measurements into a vector. Multiplying this vector with the demodulation matrix results into the Stokes vector. The demodulation matrix describes how the intensity measurements encode polarization information and is based on the architecture of the polarization modulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As this polarimeter uses a HWP as polarization modulator, it can not transform circular polarization into the linear polarization state that the polarizer transmits. Thus this polarimeter is insenstive for circular polarization. We will see this at the end of the tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing the relevant python modules. "

Using hcipy it is very easy to make these simulations more realistic by adding for example non-perfect polarization optics, atmospheric turbulence and adaptive optics, and detector noise (e.g. dark current, read noise, flat field effects).
