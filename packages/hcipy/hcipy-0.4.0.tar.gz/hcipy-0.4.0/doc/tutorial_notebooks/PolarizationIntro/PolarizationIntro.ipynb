    "2. Fully polarized wavefronts\n",
    "3. Partially polarized wavefronts\n",

These include (components of) the Stokes vector, the degree of linear/circular polarization, etc... The different types of wavefronts are distinguished by the tensor shape of the `electric_field` that is in the `Wavefront`.\n",
