Citing HCIPy
============

If you use HCIPy for your own research, we ask you to cite the HCIPy proceeding (`Por et al. 2018 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018SPIE10703E..42P>`__). If there is no appropriate place in the body text to cite the proceeding, please include something along the lines of the following in your acknowledgements:

    This research made use of HCIPy, an open-source object-oriented framework written in Python for performing end-to-end simulations of high-contrast imaging instruments (`Por et al. 2018 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018SPIE10703E..42P>`__).
