Description: X7 Geometry
        ====================
        
        Library providing some basic geometry types and operations:
        
            * ``Point``
            * ``Vector``
            * ``Line``
            * ``BezierCurve``
        
        A distinguishing feature of this library is that it is designed for
        modeling, so there are also classes like ``PointRelative`` which
        automatically updates when the underlying point is moved.  This
        is used by the morphing and animation capabilities.
