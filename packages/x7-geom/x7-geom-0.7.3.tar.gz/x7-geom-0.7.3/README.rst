X7 Geometry
====================

Library providing some basic geometry types and operations:

    * ``Point``
    * ``Vector``
    * ``Line``
    * ``BezierCurve``

A distinguishing feature of this library is that it is designed for
modeling, so there are also classes like ``PointRelative`` which
automatically updates when the underlying point is moved.  This
is used by the morphing and animation capabilities.
