Description: =============================================================================
        devpi-server: server for private package indexes and PyPI caching
        =============================================================================
        
        
        PyPI cache
        ==========
        
        You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``
        index, serving as a transparent cache for pypi-hosted packages.
        
        
        User specific indexes
        =====================
        
        Each user (which can represent a person, project or team) can have
        multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via standard ``twine`` or
        ``setup.py`` invocations.  Users and indexes can be manipulated through
        `devpi-client`_ and a RESTful HTTP API.
        
        
        Index inheritance
        =================
        
        Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves
        both its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an
        index using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a
        release candidate before you push it to PyPI.
        
        
        Good defaults and easy deployment
        =================================
        
        Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment
        including pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and process managers.
        
        
        Separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities
        ==============================================
        
        The complementary `devpi-client`_ tool
        helps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and
        installation workflows.
        
        See https://doc.devpi.net on how to get started and further documentation.

        5.5.1 (2021-03-01)
        ==================
        
        Bug Fixes
        ---------
        
        - Pin to pyramid<2.
        
        
        5.5.0 (2020-05-04)
        ==================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Proxy requests from replica to master are now streamed if possible. This improves reliability of large uploads through replicas and reduces RAM usage on the replica.
        
        
        5.4.1 (2020-03-26)
        ==================
        
        Bug Fixes
        ---------
        
        - Import won't abort anymore when a base index was removed. The bases setting will be imported as is.
        
        
        5.4.0 (2020-01-31)
        ==================
        
        .. note::
          This is the last feature release with Python 2.7 support!
        
          We will only make export related bugfix releases of 5.4.x.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - The ``requires_python`` metadata is now included in version data on mirror indexes.
        
        - Downloaded files from mirrors can be included in exports with the ``--include-mirrored-files`` option.
        
        - On import files for mirror indexes are now imported when they were included in the dump (see ``--include-mirrored-files``).
        
        
        Bug Fixes
        ---------
        
        - Fix ``--no-root-pypi`` option when importing devpi data.
        
        - Fix pushing from mirror to an index when the file was removed and ``mirror_use_external_urls`` is active.
        
        
        5.3.1 (2019-12-05)
        ==================
        
        Bug Fixes
        ---------
        
        - fix #688: on file upload existing metadata is only updated, not replaced.
