Description: # Randan
        _A python package for the analysis of social data_
        
        ### Overview
        Randan is a python package that aims to provide most of the functions presented in SPSS. Unlike the other python packages for data analysis, it has three main features, which make it attractive for social scientists:
        1. it provides the results of the analysis in a readable and understandable form, similar to SPSS
        2. it gives you information about statistical significance of the parameters whenever possible
        3. it unites all the necessary methods so you do not need to switch between different packages and software anymore
        
        As we emphasize the importance of the way your results look like, we highly suggest to use `randan` in Jupyter Notebook and store your data in `pandas` DataFrames.
