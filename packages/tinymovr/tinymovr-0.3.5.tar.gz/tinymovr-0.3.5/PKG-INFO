Description: ## Tinymovr Studio Python
        
        This is the Python client library and application that allows easy interfacing with the Tinymovr motor control board.
        
        ### Installing using pip
        
        This is the most straightforward method to install Tinymovr studio and have access to hardware. We use pip3 to ensure Tinymovr is installed using Python 3 (required).
        
            pip3 install tinymovr
        
        #### Installing earlier versions
        
        The above command will install the latest version of Tinymovr Studio available on PyPI. In order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing projects, earlier versions of Tinymovr are made available. Currently, the following versions are recommended:
        
        - [Tinymovr Studio 3.1](https://pypi.org/project/tinymovr/) (latest version)
        - [Tinymovr Studio 2.7](https://pypi.org/project/tinymovr/0.2.7/) (latest version without units)
        
        ### Installing using git clone
        
        First clone the Tinymovr repo to a local directory:
        
            git clone https://github.com/yconst/Tinymovr
        
        Then cd to the cloned repo directory and install in developer mode:
        
            cd Tinymovr/studio/Python
            pip3 install -e .
        
        ### Launching the command line app
