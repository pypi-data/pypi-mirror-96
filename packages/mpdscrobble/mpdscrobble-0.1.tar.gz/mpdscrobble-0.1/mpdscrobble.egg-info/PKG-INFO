Description: # mpdscrobble
        
        A simple Last.fm scrobbler for MPD.
        
        If you are searching for a mpd-compatible last.fm scrobbler, check out first mpdscribble, as mpdscrobble has less features than mpdscribble:
        - no journal of failed scrobbles
        - it needs a pair of Last.fm API key/secret instead of just username/password
        
        The script `mpdscribble_history.py` can be used to scrobble a list of tracks contained in a mpdscribble journal file.
