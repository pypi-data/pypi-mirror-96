## Workspace UI Development

Once this directory has been created, you're able to add as many frontends into this directory as you'd like. Each frontend will have it's own `npm run start`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test` commands that you can run from within that project directory.

To add a new frontend tool to this workspace, you can simply use the `ADD` command provided by the CLI and supply your tool name. This will create a template project for you with the appropriate naming and folder structure as well as any dependencies you'd need to build an Alteryx frontend.
