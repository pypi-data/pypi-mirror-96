# mesonpep517

This is a simple module that implements pep517 for the [meson] build system.

This means that you only need to provide a `pyproject.toml` in your project
source root to be able to publish your project built with meson on PyPi
and to create a wheel for the project.

For more information have a look at [the documentation](https://thiblahute.gitlab.io/mesonpep517/)
