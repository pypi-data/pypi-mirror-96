# Base Docker images

The `ubuntu-16.04`, `ubuntu-18.04` and `ubuntu-20.04` images are based on
[`resolwe/base:ubuntu-16.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/resolwe/base/),
[`resolwe/base:ubuntu-18.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/resolwe/base/) and
[`resolwe/base:ubuntu-18.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/resolwe/base/).

These base images should be used for writing any new processes that are
considered for inclusion into Resolwe Bio.
