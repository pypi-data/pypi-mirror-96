Description: A python project which uses dask and coiled to explore parallelism. The project produces a control heatmap for a chess game.
        HeatMap visualization shows which side controls which sqaures for each ply in the chess board. It can be used to analyze important squares, utilization, capture squares. 
        Supply chess games in form of .PGN files. An animated GIF is generated which produces a heatmap for each game in the GIF. Each frame in the GIF corresponds to a ply. Parallelism using dask tasks have been applied for handling different games(that are the input) and for calculation of power of each square in a ply (for all games).
        The tasks are run on a Coiled cluster.
