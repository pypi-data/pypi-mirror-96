Changed
~~~~~~~

- (`!73 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/73>`_) Handling of invalid regions while crunching. If crunching requests regions which aren't compatible with a file, a warning will be raised but the crunching will continue with all the valid regions it can. Previously, if invalid regions were requested, the crunch would fail and no regions would be crunched for that file.
- (`!73 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/73>`_) Renamed :class:`netcdf_scm.weights.InvalidWeights` to :class:`netcdf_scm.weights.InvalidWeightsError` and ensured that all weights-related errors are now raised as :class:`netcdf_scm.weights.InvalidWeightsError` rather than being a mix of :class:`netcdf_scm.weights.InvalidWeightsError` and :class:`ValueError` as was previously the case.
- (`!73 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/73>`_) :meth:`netcdf_scm.iris_cube_wrappers.ScmCube.get_scm_timeseries_cubes` will now raise a :class:`netcdf_scm.weights.InvalidWeightsError` if none of the requested regions have valid weights.
- (`!73 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/73>`_) Improved logging handling so only netCDF-SCM's logger is used by netCDF-SCM, with the root logger never being used.
- (`!71 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/71>`_) Rename prefix for AR6 regions from ``World|AR6 regions`` to ``World|AR6``
- (`!70 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/70>`_) Update default land-fraction cube, ``netcdf_scm.weights.default_land_ocean_weights.nc``, so they're based on CMIP6 data and treat e.g. the Caspian Sea and Great Lakes not as purely land
- (`!5 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/5>`_) Use xarray to load crunched netCDF files in :func:`netcdf_scm.io.load_scmrun`, reducing load time by about a factor of 3
- (`!64 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/64>`_) Upgraded to pymagicc 2.0.0rc5 and changed all use of :obj:`scmdata.ScmDataFrame` to :obj:`scmdata.ScmRun`
- (`!64 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/64>`_) `netcdf_scm.io.load_scmdataframe` to `netcdf_scm.io.load_scmrun` and this function now automatically drops the "todo" column on reading
- (`!62 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/62>`_) Changed command-line interface to use groups rather than hyphens. Change in commands is ``netcdf-scm-crunch`` --> ``netcdf-scm crunch``, ``netcdf-scm-stitch`` --> ``netcdf-scm stitch``, ``netcdf-scm-wrangle`` --> ``netcdf-scm wrangle``.
- (`!60 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/60>`_) Target journal for v2 paper
- (`!55 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/55>`_) Added check that region areas are sensible when calculating SCM timeseries cubes (see :meth:`ScmCube._sanity_check_area`, closes `#34 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/-/issues/34>`_)
- (`!52 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/52>`_) Put notebooks into documentation henced moved them from ``notebooks`` to ``docs/source/usage``
- (`!48 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/merge_requests/48>`_) Workaround erroneous whitespace in parent metadata when stitching (closes `#36 <https://gitlab.com/netcdf-scm/netcdf-scm/-/issues/36>`_)
