Description: # Simple Flask Stub Server
        
        [![Test package with tox](https://github.com/starlord-daniel/flask-stub-server/actions/workflows/ci-pr.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/starlord-daniel/flask-stub-server/actions/workflows/ci-pr.yml)
        
        Provides the user with a Docker container, that exposes endpoints, which can be configured via json file.
        
        ## Get Started with Flask
        
        [Documentation on the Flask website](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/)
        
        ## Configure your server
        
        The file `endpoints.json` is used to configure the server endpoints.
        To learn more about the format of the configuration file, please take a look at [Configuring the server endpoints](docs/configure-endpoints.md)
        
        Also, the [samples directory](samples/README.md) shows examples on how to configure and quickly use your own endpoint server.
        
        ## Development
        
        This project uses a virtual environment for development.
        
        More information can be found on the [Flask installation website](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#virtual-environments).
        
        ## Testing
        
        For testing, this project uses `tox`. The tox.ini configures 2 environments: lint and py39.
        
        To only run linting, use: `tox -e lint`
        To only run the tests with pytest, use: `tox -e py39`
