        ExtractCode is a universal archive extractor. It uses behind the scenes 
        the Python standard library, a custom ctypes binding to libarchive and
        the 7zip command line to extract a large number of common and
        less common archives and compressed files. It tries to extract things
        in the same way on all OSes, including auto-renaming files that would
        not have valid names on certain filesystems or when there are multiple
        copies of the same path in a given archive.
        The extraction is driven from  a "voting" system that considers the
        file extension(s) and name, the file type and mime type (using a ctypes
        binding to libmagic) to select the most appropriate extractor or
        uncompressor function. It can handle multi-level archives such as tar.gz.
