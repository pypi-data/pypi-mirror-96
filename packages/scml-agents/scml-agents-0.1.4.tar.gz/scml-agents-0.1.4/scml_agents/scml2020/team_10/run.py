    """
    **Not needed for submission.** You can use this function to test your agent.

    Args:
        competition: The competition type to run (possibilities are std,
                     collusion).
        n_steps:     The number of simulation steps.
        n_configs:   Number of different world configurations to try.
                     Different world configurations will correspond to
                     different number of factories, profiles
                     , production graphs etc
        n_runs_per_world: How many times will each world simulation be run.

    Returns:
        None

    Remarks:

        - This function will take several minutes to run.
        - To speed it up, use a smaller `n_step` value
