Description: # Introduction
        
        Generic batch processing framework for managing the orchestration, dispatch, fault tolerance, and monitoring of 
        arbitrary work items against many endpoints. Extensible via dependency injection. 
        
        Includes examples against Azure Cognitive Service containers for ML eval workloads.
        
        # Usage
        
        The `batchkit` package is available as an ordinary pypi package. See versions here: https://pypi.org/project/batchkit
        
        # Examples
        
        ### Speech Batch Kit
        The Speech Batch Kit (batchkit_examples/speech_sdk) uses the framework to produce a tool that can be used for
        transcription of very large numbers of audio files against Azure Cognitive Service Speech containers or cloud endpoints.
        
        For introduction, see the [Azure Cognitive Services page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-container-batch-processing).
        
        For detailed information, see the [Speech Batch Kit's README](https://github.com/microsoft/batch-processing-kit/blob/master/batchkit_examples/speech_sdk/README.md).
