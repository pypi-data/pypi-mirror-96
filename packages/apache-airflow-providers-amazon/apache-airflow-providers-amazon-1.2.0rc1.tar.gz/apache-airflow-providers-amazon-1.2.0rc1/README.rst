Package ``apache-airflow-providers-amazon``

Release: ``1.2.0rc1``


Amazon integration (including `Amazon Web Services (AWS) <https://aws.amazon.com/>`__).


Provider package
================

This is a provider package for ``amazon`` provider. All classes for this provider package
are in ``airflow.providers.amazon`` python package.

You can find package information and changelog for the provider
in the `documentation <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-amazon/1.2.0/>`_.


Installation
============

NOTE!

On November 2020, new version of PIP (20.3) has been released with a new, 2020 resolver. This resolver
does not yet work with Apache Airflow and might lead to errors in installation - depends on your choice
of extras. In order to install Airflow you need to either downgrade pip to version 20.2.4
``pip install --upgrade pip==20.2.4`` or, in case you use Pip 20.3, you need to add option
``--use-deprecated legacy-resolver`` to your pip install command.

You can install this package on top of an existing airflow 2.* installation via
``pip install apache-airflow-providers-amazon``
