<h1 class="title">Running the Quixote Demos</h1>

<p>Quixote comes with some demonstration applications in the demo directory.
After quixote is installed (see INSTALL.txt for instructions),
you can run the demos using the scripts located in the server directory.</p>
<p>Each server script is written for a specific method of connecting a
quixote publisher to a web server, and you will ultimately want to
choose the one that matches your needs. More information about the
different server scripts may be found in the scripts themselves and in
web-server.txt.  To start, though, the easiest way to view the demos
is as follows: in a terminal window, run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m quixote.server.simple_server
</pre>
<p>and in a browser, open <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.  If you wish to run the
demo on a remote computer, you will need to ask the server to listen
on a public network interface.  Usually:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m quixote.server.simple_server --host=0
</pre>
<p>In your browser, replace <cite>localhost</cite> with the name of the server.</p>
<p>The simple_server.py script prints a usage message if you run it with a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--help</span></tt> command line argument.  You can run different Quixote
applications by using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--factory</span></tt> option to identify a callable
that creates the publisher you want to use.  In particular, you might
try these demos:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m quixote.server.simple_server \
  --factory quixote.demo.mini_demo.create_publisher
</pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m quixote.server.simple_server \
  --factory quixote.demo.altdemo.create_publisher
</pre>
<div class="section" id="understanding-the-mini-demo">
<h1>Understanding the mini_demo</h1>
<p>Start the mini demo by running the command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m quixote.server.simple_server \
  --factory quixote.demo.mini_demo.create_publisher
</pre>
<p>In a browser, load <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.  In your browser, you should
see <tt class="docutils literal">Welcome ...</tt> page.  In your terminal window, you will see a
<tt class="docutils literal">localhost - - ...</tt> line for each request.  These are access log
messages from the web server.</p>
<p>Look at the source code in <cite>demo/mini_demo.py</cite>.  Near the bottom you
will find the create_publisher() function.  The create_publisher()
function creates a Publisher instance whose root directory is an
instance of the RootDirectory class defined just above.  Each Quixote
application has one Publisher instance.  When a request arrives, the
Publisher traverses the path of the URL, using the RootDirectory object.</p>
<p>For the URL <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>, Quixote traverses the path list:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
['']
</pre>
<p>This path results in the function exported using the empty string as
its name being called.  The return value is send back to the browser,
after adding some basic HTTP headers.</p>
<p>To prevent potentially sensitive internal parts of your application are
not exposed as callable URLs, Quixote requires that each Directory
component must be explictly exported.  Internally this is done using the
_q_exports attribute of Directory objects.  For convenience, a decorator
function called 'export' is made available which takes care of updating
the _q_exports list.</p>
<p>The 'export' decorator takes a single, optional keyword argument 'name'.
If not provided, the exported name defaults to the name of the function.</p>
<p>The mini demo contains only a single page besides the root page.  The
URL is <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080/hello">http://localhost:8080/hello</a>.  Quixote traverses the path list:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
['hello']
</pre>
<p>and finds the <tt class="docutils literal">hello</tt> method of the <tt class="docutils literal">RootDirectory</tt> object.  It
calls the method and returns the result as page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="understanding-the-root-demo">
<h1>Understanding the root demo</h1>
<p>Start the root demo by running the command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m quixote.server.simple_server
</pre>
<p>In a browser, open <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> as before.
Click around at will.</p>
<p>This is the default demo, but it is more complicated than the
mini_demo described above.  The create_publisher() function in
quixote.demo.__init__.py creates a publisher whose root directory is
an instance of quixote.demo.root.RootDirectory.  Note that the source
code is a file named &quot;root.ptl&quot;.  The suffix of &quot;ptl&quot; indicates that
it is a PTL file, and the import must follow a call to
quixote.enable_ptl() or else the source file will not be found or
compiled.  The quixote.demo.__init__.py file takes care of that.</p>
<p>Take a look at the source code in root.ptl.  You will see code that
looks like regular python, except that some function definitions have
&quot;[html]&quot; between the function name and the parameter list.  These
functions are ptl templates.  For details about PTL, see the PTL.txt
file.</p>
<p>This RootDirectory class is similar to the one in mini_demo.py, in
that it has a index() method and it is exported with the name '' (i.e.
the empty string).</p>
<p>Looking at the RootDirectoryMethods, including plain(), css() and
favicon_ico(), you will see examples where, in addition to returning a
string containing the body of the HTTP response, the function also
makes side-effect modifications to the response object itself, to set
the content type and the expiration time for the response.
Most of the time, these direct modifications to the response are
not needed.  When they are, though, the get_response() function
gives you direct access to the response instance.</p>
<p>The RootDirectory here also sets an 'extras' attribute to be an
instance of ExtraDirectory, imported from the quixote.demo.extras
module.  Note that 'extras' explicitly appears in the _q_exports list.
This is the ordinary way to extend your URL space through another '/'.
For example, the URL path '/extras/' will result in a call to the
ExtraDirectory instance's index() method.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-q-lookup-method">
<h1>The _q_lookup() method</h1>
<p>Now take a look at the ExtraDirectory class in extras.ptl.  This class
exhibits some more advanced publishing features.  If you look back at
the default _q_traverse() implementation (in directory.py), you will
see that the _q_traverse does not give up if _q_translate() returns
None, indicating that the path component has no designated
corresponding attribute name.  In this case, _q_traverse() tries
calling self._q_lookup() to see if the object of interest can be found
in a different way.  Note that _q_lookup() takes the component as an
argument and must return either (if there is more path to traverse) a
Directory instance, or else (if the component is the last in the path)
a callable or a string.</p>
<p>In this particular case, the ExtrasDirectory._q_lookup() call returns
an instance of IntegerUI (a subclass of Directory).  The interest
here, unlike the ExtrasDirectory() instance itself, is created
on-the-fly during the traversal, especially for this particular
component.  Try loading <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080/extras/12/">http://localhost:8080/extras/12/</a> to see how
this behaves.</p>
<p>Note that the correct URL to get to the IntegerUI(12).index() call
ends with a '/'.  This can sometimes be confusing to people who expect
<a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080/extras/12">http://localhost:8080/extras/12</a> to yield the same page as
<a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080/extras/12/">http://localhost:8080/extras/12/</a>.  If given the path ['extras', '12'],
the default _q_traverse() ends up <em>calling</em> the instance of IntegerUI.
The Directory.__call__() (see directory.py) determines the result: if
no form values were submitted and adding a slash would produce a page,
the call returns the result of calling quixote.redirect().  The
redirect() call here causes the server to issue a permanent redirect
response to the path with the slash added.  When this automatic
redirect is used, a message is printed to the error log.  If the
conditions for a redirect are not met, the call falls back to raising
a TraversalError.  [Note, if you don't like this redirect behavior,
override, replace, or delete Directory.__call__]</p>
<p>The _q_lookup() pattern is useful when you want to allow URL
components that you either don't know or don't want to list in
_q_exports ahead of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-q-resolve-method">
<h1>The _q_resolve() method</h1>
<p>Note that the ExtraDirectory class inherits from Resolving (in
addition to Directory).  The Resolving mixin modifies the
_q_traverse() so that, when a component has an attribute name
designated by _q_translate(), but the Directory instance does not
actually <em>have</em> that attribute, the _q_resolve() method is called to
&quot;resolve&quot; the trouble.  Typically, the _q_resolve() imports or
constructs what <em>should</em> be the value of the designated attribute.
The modified _q_translate() sets the attribute value so that the
_q_resolve() won't be called again for the same attribute.  The
_q_resolve() pattern is useful when you want to delay the work of
constructing the values for exported attributes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="forms">
<h1>Forms</h1>
<p>You can't get very far writing web applications without writing forms.
The root demo includes, at <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8080/extras/form">http://localhost:8080/extras/form</a>, a page
that demonstrates basic usage of the Form class and widgets defined in
the quixote.form package.</p>
