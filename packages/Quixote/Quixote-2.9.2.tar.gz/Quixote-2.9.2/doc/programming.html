<h1 class="title">Quixote Programming Overview</h1>

<p>This document explains how a Quixote application is structured.
The demo.txt file should probably be read before you read this file.
There are three components to a Quixote application:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">A driver script, usually a CGI or FastCGI script.  This is the
interface between your web server (eg., Apache) and the bulk of your
application code.  The driver script is responsible for creating a
Quixote publisher customized for your application and invoking its
publishing loop.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A configuration file.  This file specifies various features of the
Publisher class, such as how errors are handled, the paths of
various log files, and various other things.  Read through
quixote/config.py for the full list of configuration settings.</p>
<p>The most important configuration parameters are:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">ERROR_EMAIL</tt></dt>
<dd><p class="first last">e-mail address to which errors will be mailed</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">ERROR_LOG</tt></dt>
<dd><p class="first last">file to which errors will be logged</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>For development/debugging, you should also set <tt class="docutils literal">DISPLAY_EXCEPTIONS</tt>
true; the default value is false, to favor security over convenience.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Finally, the bulk of the code will be called through a call (by the
Publisher) to the _q_traverse() method of an instance designated as
the <tt class="docutils literal">root_directory</tt>.  Normally, the root_directory will be an
instance of the Directory class.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="driver-script">
<h1>Driver script</h1>
<p>The driver script is the interface between your web server and Quixote's
&quot;publishing loop&quot;, which in turn is the gateway to your application
code.  Thus, there are two things that your Quixote driver script must
do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>create a Quixote publisher -- that is, an instance of the Publisher
class provided by the quixote.publish module -- and customize it for
your application</li>
<li>invoke the publisher's process_request() method as needed to get
responses for one or more requests, writing the responses back
to the client(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>The publisher is responsible for translating URLs to Python objects and
calling the appropriate function, method, or PTL template to retrieve
the information and/or carry out the action requested by the URL.</p>
<p>The most important application-specific customization done by the driver
script is to set the root directory of your application.</p>
<p>The quixote.servers package includes driver modules for cgi, fastcgi,
scgi, medusa, twisted, and the simple_server.  Each of these modules
includes a <tt class="docutils literal">run()</tt> function that you can use in a driver script that
provides a function to create the publisher that you want.  For an example
of this pattern, see the __main__ part of demo/mini_demo.py.  You could
run the mini_demo.py with scgi by using the <tt class="docutils literal">run()</tt> function imported
from quixote.server.scgi_server instead of the one from
quixote.server.simple_server.  (You would also need your http server
set up to use the scgi server.)</p>
<p>That's almost the simplest possible case -- there's no
application-specific configuration info apart from the root directory.</p>
<p>Getting the driver script to actually run is between you and your web
server.  See the web-server.txt document for help.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration-file">
<h1>Configuration file</h1>
<p>By default, the Publisher uses the configuration information from
quixote/config.py.  You should never edit the default values in
quixote/config.py, because your edits will be lost if you upgrade to a
newer Quixote version.  You should certainly read it, though, to
understand what all the configuration variables are.  If you want to
customize any of the configuration variables, your driver script
should provide your customized Config instance as an argument to the
Publisher constructor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging">
<h1>Logging</h1>
<p>The publisher also accepts an optional <tt class="docutils literal">logger</tt> keyword argument,
that should, if provided, support the same methods as the
default value, an instance of <tt class="docutils literal">DefaultLogger</tt>.  Even if you
use the default logger, you can still customize the behavior
by setting configuration values for <tt class="docutils literal">access_log</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">error_log</tt>, and/or
<tt class="docutils literal">error_email</tt>.  These configuration variables are described
more fully in config.py.</p>
<p>Quixote writes one (rather long) line to the access log for each request
it handles; we have split that line up here to make it easier to read:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
127.0.0.1 - 2001-10-15 09:48:43
  2504 &quot;GET /catalog/ HTTP/1.1&quot;
  200 'Opera/6.0 (Linux; U)' 0.100s
</pre>
<p>This line consists of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>client IP address</li>
<li>current user (according to Quixote session management mechanism,
so this will be &quot;-&quot; unless you're using a session manager that
does authentication)</li>
<li>date and time of request in local timezone, as YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss</li>
<li>process ID of the process serving the request (eg. your CGI/FastCGI
driver script)</li>
<li>the HTTP request line (request method, URI, and protocol)</li>
<li>response status code</li>
<li>HTTP user agent string (specifically, this is
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repr(os.environ.get('HTTP_USER_AGENT',</span> <span class="pre">''))</span></tt>)</li>
<li>time to complete the request</li>
</ul>
<p>If no access log is configured (ie., <tt class="docutils literal">ACCESS_LOG</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>), then
Quixote will not do any access logging.</p>
<p>The error log is used for three purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>application output to <tt class="docutils literal">sys.stdout</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">sys.stderr</tt> goes to
Quixote's error log</li>
<li>application tracebacks will be written to Quixote's error log</li>
</ul>
<p>If no error log is configured (with <tt class="docutils literal">ERROR_LOG</tt>), then all output is
redirected to the stderr supplied to Quixote for this request by your
web server.  At least for CGI/FastCGI scripts under Apache, this winds
up in Apache's error log.</p>
<p>Having stdout redirected to the error log is useful for debugging.  You
can just sprinkle <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> statements into your application and the
output will wind up in the error log.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="application-code">
<h1>Application code</h1>
<p>Finally, we reach the most complicated part of a Quixote application.
However, thanks to Quixote's design, everything you've ever learned
about designing and writing Python code is applicable, so there are no
new hoops to jump through.  You may, optionally, wish to use PTL,
which is simply Python with a novel way of generating function return
values -- see PTL.txt for details.</p>
<p>Quixote's Publisher constructs a request, splits the path into a list
of components, and calls the root directory's _q_traverse() method,
giving the component list as an argument.  The _q_traverse() will either
return a value that will become the content of the HTTPResponse, or
else it may raise an Exception.  Exceptions are caught by the Publisher
and handled as needed, depending on configuration variables and
whether or not the Exception is an instance of PublisherError.</p>
