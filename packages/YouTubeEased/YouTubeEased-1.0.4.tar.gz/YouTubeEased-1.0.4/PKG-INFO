Description: # YouTubeEased:
        A YouTube API based library which will make your coding faster and better.
        DISCLAIMER!
        This library is vary basic and not very stabled, therefore you might get some errors.
        ## Install:
        ```pip install YouTubeEased```
        ## Library Needed:
        ```youtube_dl```
        ## How To Call The Library??
        ```python
        # This way you call the __init__ function of the library!
        from YouTubeEased import YouTubeEased
        ```
        
        ## Great What Now?
        Now we need to actually call the function by typing:
        ```python
        from YouTubeEased import YouTubeEased
        
        # Here you type the URL!
        youtube = YouTubeEased("URL")
        ```
        If you don't want to use the regular way, you can also call the function from the `utils`.
        
        ```python
        # All the functions can be taken by this way too!
        from YouTubeEased.utils import *
        ```
        ### Why You should try using the other way?
        - Have more control of what you want to use
        - You will be able to use any URL even if the URL is not been supported (The normal way is checking the url)!
        
        ## Examples
        
        ```python
        from YouTubeEased import YouTubeEased
        from YouTubeEased.utils import URLNotSupported
        
        
        def download(url) -> None:
            # except URL errors
            try:
                youtube = YouTubeEased(url)
                print("URL Valid")
            except URLNotSupported:
                print("URL not supported!")
            # -----------------------------------#
            #                OR:                #
            # -----------------------------------#
            if YouTubeEased(url).is_good_url():
                print("URL Valid")
            else:
                print("URL not supported!")
        
        
        user = input("Type URL: ")
        download(user)
        ```
        
        ```python
        from YouTubeEased import YouTubeEased
        
        user_url = input("Type URL: ")
        user_fname = input("Type file name: ")
        user_type_download = input("1. Video" 
                                   "2. Audio"
                                   "Type Here: ")
        
        youtube = YouTubeEased(user_url)
        youtube.rename(user_fname)
        
        if user_type_download == '1':
            youtube.download_video()
        elif user_type_download == '2':
            youtube.download_audio()
        else:
            print("Wrong input.")
        ```
