PyArmor is a command line tool used to obfuscate python scripts, bind
obfuscated scripts to fixed machine or expire obfuscated scripts. It
protects Python scripts by the following ways:

* Obfuscate code object to protect constants and literal strings.
* Obfuscate co_code of each function (code object) in runtime.
* Clear f_locals of frame as soon as code object completed execution.
* Verify the license file of obfuscated scripts while running it.
