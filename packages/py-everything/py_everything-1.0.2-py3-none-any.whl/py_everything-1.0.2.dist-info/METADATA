# py_everything
A python module containing all the basic functions and classes for python. From simple addition to advanced file encryption. Everything is included in this one package.

It allows you to use many of its functions and classes without having to write huge complex code. It is a very simple and easy to use library. 

# Installation
Being available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org), you can install it as simply as ever!

```
py_everything officially supports Python 3.0+

# Features
- You can make use of the thousands of functions and classes available to you.
- You don't have to write all of that code yourself, just call the pre-made functions.
- You can inherit from our base class, and make your own with customizations.
- There are two variants of most classes, a `Base` variant and an `Advanced` variant.
- Make your own classes from our pre-provided `Base` variants. The Advanced ones are not for inheriting, but you could experiment.
