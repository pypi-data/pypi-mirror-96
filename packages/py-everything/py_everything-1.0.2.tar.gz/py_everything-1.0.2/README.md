# Features
- You can make use of the thousands of functions and classes available to you.
- You don't have to write all of that code yourself, just call the pre-made functions.
- You can inherit from our base class, and make your own with customizations.
- There are two variants of most classes, a `Base` variant and an `Advanced` variant.
- Make your own classes from our pre-provided `Base` variants. The Advanced ones are not for inheriting, but you could experiment.
