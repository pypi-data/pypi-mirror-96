## OriginExt

This package is a low-level API for interacting with the Origin software via the Origin Automation Server COM interface. An instance of Origin is launched (either visible or hidden) when using this package. This package is largely undocumented and support is limited.

**Developers are urged to use the [originpro package](https://pypi.org/project/originpro/) because it offers a high-level, more Pythonic interface for interacting with Origin.**

### Installation
This package is Windows only and requires a local installation of Origin 2021 or later software.

To install the package, run:
```
pip install OriginExt
```

### Documentation
Limited documentation is available in the [OriginLab External Python Documentation](https://www.originlab.com/doc/ExternalPython).

### Support
Limited support is available on the [Origin Forum for Python](https://my.originlab.com/forum/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=29).
