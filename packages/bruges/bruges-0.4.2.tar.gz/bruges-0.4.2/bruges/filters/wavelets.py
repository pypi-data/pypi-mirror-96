    as described in Aldridge, DF (1990), The Berlage wavelet, GEOPHYSICS
    55 (11), p 1508-1511. Berlage wavelets are causal, minimum phase and
    useful for modeling marine airgun sources.

        plt.plot(bruges.filters.berlage(0.5, 0.002, 40))

    Args:
        duration (float): The length in seconds of the wavelet.
        dt (float): The sample interval in seconds (often one of  0.001, 0.002,
            or 0.004).
        f (array-like): Centre frequency of the wavelet in Hz. If a sequence is

        n (float): The time exponent; non-negative and real.
        alpha(float): The exponential decay factor; non-negative and real.
        phi (float): The phase.
        t (array-like): The time series to evaluate at, if you don't want one
            to be computed. If you pass `t` then `duration` and `dt` will be
            ignored, so we recommend passing `None` for those arguments.
        return_t (bool): If True, then the function returns a tuple of
            wavelet, time-basis.
        sym (bool): If True (default behaviour before v0.5) then the wavelet
            is forced to have an odd number of samples and the central sample
            is at 0 time.

    Returns:
        ndarray. Berlage wavelet(s) with centre frequency f sampled on t. If
            you passed `return_t=True` then a tuple of (wavelet, t) is returned.

    Wang's generalized wavelet, of which the Ricker is a special case where
