
Authentication
==============

This package interacts with `Deep Intelligence API <https://app.deepint.net/api/v1/documentation/>`_. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a token in the header of each transaction, which must be provided to this package in order to operate. 
This section discusses how to provide such a token to the package in the various ways in which it is offered.


How to setup credentials
------------------------

Credentials can be set up with one of the following methods (the token is loaded in the priority defined in the order of the following items):
 - instance credentials object with the token optional parameter `c = Credentials(token='a token')`
 - create a environment variable called `DEEPINT_TOKEN` with the token value.
 - create a .ini file in your home directory called `.deepint` coninting in the `DEFAULT` section a key called `token` like in following example

.. code-block::
   :caption: ~/.deepint.ini

	[DEFAULT]
	token=a token



How to obtain a token
---------------------

In order to interact with the Deep Intelligence API, it is necessary to obtain a token that is attached to each request. To do this, first, you must log in, after which you must go to the `account configuration page <https://app.deepint.net/workspace?ws=&s=account>`_  and go to the "Authorizations" section. There you must click on the "Create new authorization token" button as shown in the image below:

After that, a modal will appear, where you can configure the permissions and expiration of the token:

Finally, by pressing the key button as shown in the image below, the token is obtained:

You can create as many tokens as the organization plan allows.
