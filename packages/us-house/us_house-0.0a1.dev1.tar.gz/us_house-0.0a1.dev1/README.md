# us-house ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

A package for working with U.S. House of Representatives metadata. Like [python-us](https://github.com/unitedstates/python-us), but for bills, member information and more!

(Note: This library represents rough half the functionality of the [`congress`](https://pypi.org/project/congress/) project, along with its counterpart, [`us-senate`](https://pypi.org/project/us-senate/). They are distributed separately so users have the option of keeping dependency bundles small.)

### Quickstart

```
$ pip install us-house
```
