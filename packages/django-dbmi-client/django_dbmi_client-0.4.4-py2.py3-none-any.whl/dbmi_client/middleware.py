    What sets this middelware apart from `DBMIAuthenticationMiddleware` is admin users are checked

    appropriate to ensure changes to administrator permissions are checked with every request to prevent
    a cached user to have elevated permissions after those permissions might have been revoked at the
    authorization server. Normal users are cached and fetched normally and this do not impose the
    additional overhead of double-checking status.
