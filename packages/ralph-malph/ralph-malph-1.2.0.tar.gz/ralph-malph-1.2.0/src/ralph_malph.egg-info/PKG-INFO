Description: # Ralph
        
        Ralph is a command-line tool to fetch, extract, convert and push your tracking
        logs (_aka_ learning events) from various storage backends to your LRS or any
        other compatible storage or database backend.
        
        ## Quick start guide
        
        Ralph is distributed as a standard python package; it can be installed _via_
        `pip` or any other python package manager (_e.g_ Poetry, Pipenv, etc.):
        
        ```
        $ pip install ralph-malph
        ```
        
        Once installed, the `ralph` command should be available in your `PATH`. Try to
        invoke the program usage thanks to the `--help` flag:
        
        ```
        $ ralph --help
        ```
        
        You should see a list of available commands and global flags for `ralph`. Note
        that each command has its own usage that can be invoked _via_:
        
        ```
        $ ralph COMMAND --help
        ```
        
        > You should substitute `COMMAND` by the target command, _e.g._ `list`, to see
        > its usage.
