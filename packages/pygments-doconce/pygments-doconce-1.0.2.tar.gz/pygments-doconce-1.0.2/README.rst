pygments-doconce: syntax coloring for DocOnce files
===================================================

Overview
--------

This package provides a `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_ lexer for
`DocOnce <http://doconce.github.io/doconce>`_ files.
The lexer is published as an entry point and, once installed, Pygments will
pick it up automatically.

You can then use the ``doconce`` language with Pygments::

        $ pygmentize -l doconce test.do.txt

In `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documents the lexer is selected with
the ``highlight`` directive::

        .. highlight:: doconce

Thanks to pygments-openssl project for providing a template `<https://github.com/stefanholek/pygments-openssl>`_
