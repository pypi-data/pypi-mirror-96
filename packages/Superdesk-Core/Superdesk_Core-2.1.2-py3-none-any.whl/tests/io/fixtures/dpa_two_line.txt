Peace talks on Yemen to take place in Sweden next month, Mattis says =

Washington (dpa) - US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis says he expects
the warring parties in Yemen to hold peace talks in Sweden early next
month.

Representatives of the Houthi rebel side, the government of Yemen
under the leadership of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and UN
special envoy Martin Griffiths will be present, Mattis told reporters
at the Pentagon.

He credited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for being
"fully onboard" with this effort.

Mattis also said progress is being made to end the fighting, and in
recent days it has decreased considerably.
