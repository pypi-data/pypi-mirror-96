<p>The Great British Bake Off has made a clean sweep of the top five most-watched programmes of the year so far.</p>
          <p>An average of almost 13-and-a-half million people have tuned in to each episode of the hit BBC One cookery competition, new figures reveal.</p>
          <p>It is the largest number of viewers the show has ever attracted in its seven-year history.</p>
          <p>Should Bake Off continue to pull in such an audience, it is likely all 10 episodes of this year's series will end up in the top 10 most-watched programmes of 2016.</p>
          <p>The ratings, which have been published by the research body Barb, include people who recorded the show then watched it up to seven days after transmission.</p>
          <p>They cover only the first five episodes, and do not include the sixth instalment which aired on <chron>September 28</chron>.</p>
          <p>The one programme that has come close to equalling Bake Off's ratings this year is <location>Britain's</location> Got Talent, an episode of which had almost 12.5 million viewers in April.</p>
          <p>Last year's Bake Off final was watched by 15.1 million people - a figure that could well be exceeded this year.</p>
          <p>Such a feat would set the bar extremely high for Bake Off's next series, which is due to air on Channel 4 after the BBC refused to pay a reported Â£25 million a year to keep the broadcasting rights.</p>
          <p>Here are the 10 most-watched programmes of 2016 so far:</p>
          <p>1. The Great British Bake Off (BBC One), <chron>August 24</chron>: 13.58 million</p>
          <p>2. The Great British Bake Off (BBC One), <chron>August 31</chron>: 13.45 million</p>
          <p>3. The Great British Bake Off (BBC One), <chron>September 14</chron>: 13.29 million</p>
          <p>4. The Great British Bake Off (BBC One), <chron>September 21</chron>: 13.12 million</p>
          <p>5. The Great British Bake Off (BBC One), <chron>September 7</chron>: 13.08 million</p>
          <p>6. <location>Britain's</location> Got Talent (ITV), <chron>April 16</chron>: 12.46 million</p>
          <p>7. <location>Britain's</location> Got Talent (ITV), <chron>April 23</chron>: 12.32 million</p>
          <p>8. <money>Euro 2016</money>: <location>Portugal</location> v <location>France</location> (BBC One), <chron>July 10</chron>: 12.27 million</p>
          <p>9. <money>Euro 2016</money>: Wales v Belgium analysis (BBC One), <chron>July 1</chron>: 11.89 million</p>
          <p>10. <location>Britain's</location> Got Talent (ITV) <chron>April 30</chron>: 11.87 million</p>
