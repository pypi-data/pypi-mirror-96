Chiefs-Rams 2.0? Would be a fun Super Bowl, but don't count on it
By Tom Krasovic, The San Diego Union-Tribune =

San Diego (tca/dpa) - History says this wasn't a Super Bowl preview
that played out Monday night in the old Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum.

Here's hoping the history is wrong.

Chiefs-Rams 2.0 would be worthy of Roman numerals, although the light
bulbs in the Atlanta dome may burn out.

The final score Monday:

Rams 54, Chiefs 51.

"What a great football game tonight," Rams coach Sean McVay said.

Life can't be all dessert, and for football lovers, too many
touchdowns can make the sport look like something other than
football. (This was the third highest-scoring game in NFL history.)

Yet the defenders got to dance in the end zone, too, combining for
three touchdowns of their own, two by the Rams.

And when the game was in the balance, Rams defenders made sure the
54-51 lead held up.

Samson Ebukam, an edge rusher who scored both Rams defensive TDs, put
a hit on Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes to cause a flutterball
that cornerback Marcus Peters, a former Chiefs All-Pro, picked off
near midfield with 1:15 to play.

Feisty moments Monday could add spice to a Super Bowl rematch. Chiefs
coach Andy Reid appeared to snap at Rams quarterback Jared Goff,
while both were lobbying the officials in the first half. Peters, on
the sideline, had to be restrained while imploring the refs to flag a
Chiefs pass defender.

Wearing white jerseys and white pants, the Chiefs reprised the
sartorial look that the 1966 Chiefs wore in the Coliseum for the
first Super Bowl.

The TD-friendly climate of today's NFL is not one that Vince Lombardi
and Hank Stram, coaches in the first Super Bowl, would recognize.

Defenders were flagged, early and often, in many instances for too
much clinging on pass routes.

The Chiefs were whistled 10 times in the first quarter alone, and six
of the violations were on their defensive backs.

It was still fun to watch the precision and vision of the
quarterbacks: third-year starter Goff and Mahomes, whose amazing arm
strength elicited "wows" from some of the 77,002 in attendance.

"A really competitive game with a lot of high-caliber plays in all
three phases," said McVay. "Great job of both teams being able to
deliver a great product."

For "best player" honours, go with Tyreek Hill for offence and Aaron
Donald and Ebukam as co-winners for defense.

Hill was too quick and too fast for any Rams defender. He made it a
rough night for Sam Shields, a 30-year-old who filled in for the
injured Aqib Talib.

Hill finished with 10 catches for 215 yards and two scores.

Donald, the defensive tackle, showed the burst and Bruce Lee hand
move that can prevent blockers from double-teaming him. Twice he
whipped guard Cameron Erving to cause a fumble, one that Ebukam
returned for his first touchdown.

Ebukam made an astonishing interception that he took back for a
second TD. Perhaps he was a bit lucky, too _ but while grappling with
a Chiefs tackle he batted and then controlled a Mahomes pass.

The Chiefs, as is their norm, made several good plays on special
teams, especially in kick coverage.

But Rams punter Johnny Hekker's 66-yard punt preceded the
interception that all but claimed the victory.

Why the Chiefs lost can be distilled to their 13 penalties and the
five turnovers on Mahomes - but Mahomes also threw for six touchdown
passes while amassing 478 yards on 33-of-46 passing.

Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was too elusive on many plays and
finished with 10 catches for 127 yards and a touchdown.

"I feel like I may need a couple of beverages to relax tonight,"
McVay said.

Both teams will come out of their bye next week with a inside chance
to win not only a divisional title but a first-round playoff bye.

The Rams (10-1) have all but won the NFC West, where the Seahawks
(5-5) are second. They are tied with the NFC-leading Saints, who beat
them in New Orleans.

The Saints are the coolest kids in this year's touchdown-happy
season, averaging 37.8 points per game, followed by the Chiefs and
Rams at 35.3 and 33.5 entering last night.

The Chiefs (9-2) lead the Chargers (7-3) in the AFC West and beat
them in Week 1, giving them an edge.

None of the accomplishments scream "Super Bowl," though.

The Rams have never won a Super Bowl while based in L.A. and are 1-6
in the NFC title game as an L.A. franchise. If the Saints stay
healthy, they stand to be favoured on betting lines to reach and win
their second Super Bowl.

The Chiefs haven't been to the Super Bowl since Stram led the 1969
club to victory in Super Bowl IV.

They hope to regain their best defender, Eric Berry, this season, but
the safety hasn't played since Week 1 of the 2017 season. After
allowing the Rams 8.1 yards per play Monday night - Goff was 31 of 49
for 413 yards with four touchdown passes, no interceptions and also a
7-yard scoring run - Kansas City's hopes will hinge on firming its
defence.
