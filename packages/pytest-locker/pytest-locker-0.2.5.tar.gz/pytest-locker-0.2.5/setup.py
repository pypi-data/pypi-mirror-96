(Especially usefull for data heavy unittests)\n- Easy to verify changes: \n\n  - Seperates logic of the test and expected values in the test further\n  - Lock files, and changes to them, are easy to interpret. \n    Therefore, evaluting them in pull-requests a great method of quality controll. \n\nInstall\n=======\nrun ``pip install pytest-locker``\n\nUse\n===\n- *Step 1:* Add ``from pytest_locker import locker`` to your\n  `conftest.py <https://docs.pytest.org/en/2.7.3/plugins.html?highlight=re>`_ file\n- *Step 2:* To access the locker by adding it to the method parameters i.e. ``def test_example(locker)``\n- *Step 3:* Use ``locker.lock(your_string, optional_name)`` to lock the data.\n- *Additionally:* Don\'t forget to commit the ``.pytest_locker/`` directory for ci/cd testing\n\nAnd you\'re all set!\n\nTip\n===\nWhen using locks to test your file it is even more important than usual that the\n`pytest rootdir <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/customize.html>`_ is fixed.\nClick the `link <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/customize.html>`_ for all the options\n(one is adding a ``pytest.ini`` to the root folder).\n\nThe Locker test Flows\n=====================\nThere are two modes based on for locking.\n\n- When user input is allowed, i.e. when running pytest with ``--capture  no`` or ``-s``\n\n  When user input is allowed and the given data does not correspond to the data in the lock\n  the *user is prompted* if the new data should be stored or if the tests should fail.\n\n- When user input is captured which is default behavior for pytest\n\n  If user input is not allowed the tests will *automatically fail* if the expected lock file does not exist\n  or if the data does not correspond to the data in the lock file.\n\nThe Locker class\n================\nYou can also use ``pytest_locker.Locker`` (i.e. the class of which the ``locker`` fixture returns an instance).\ndirectly to create fixtures that locks a (non-string) object without needing to turn the object into a string it.\n\nExamples\n========\nFor example of use look at the tests in `<https://github.com/Luttik/repr_utils>`_.\n',
