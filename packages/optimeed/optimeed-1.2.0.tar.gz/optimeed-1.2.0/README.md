Optimeed is a very powerful optimization and data visualization tool.
It handles gradient-free optimizations, e.g., NSGAII or Particle Swarm optimizations.
The true power of this package resides in interactive graph interactions, that allow to visualize, delete, extract, ... data easily.
See [The documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/optimeed/) for more info.

**Requirements**

* PyQt5 for visualisation -> `pip install PyQt5`
* `pyopengl` for visualisation -> `pip install PyOpenGL`
* Numpy -> `pip install numpy`
* Optional
    * pandas which is only used to export excel files -> `pip install pandas`
    * `nlopt` library for using other types of algorithm. -> `pip install nlopt`
    * inkscape software for exporting graphs in .png and .pdf)
    * `plotly` library for 3D plots. -> `pip install plotly`

**License**

The project is distributed "has it is" under [GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.fr.html), which is a strong copyleft license.
This means that the code is open-source and you are free to do anything you want with it, **as long as you apply the same license to distribute your code**.
This constraining license is imposed by the use of [Platypus Library](https://platypus.readthedocs.io/en/docs/index.html) as "optimization algorithm library", which is under GPL license.

It is perfectly possible to use other optimization library (which would use the same algorithms but with a different implementation) and to interface it to this project, so that the use of platypus is no longer needed. This work has already been done for [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is under MIT license (not constraining at all).
In that case, **after removing all the platypus sources** (optiAlgorithms/multiObjective_GA and optiAlgorithsm/platypus/*), the license of the present work becomes less restrictive: [GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html). As for the GPL, this license makes the project open-source and free to be modified, but (nearly) no limitation is made to distribute your code.
