        ## Terminal reminder tool
        ### PIP Install:
        * `pip3 install termremind`
        * For any `*nix` (MacOS included, I think?):
            * You need to make sure that `~/.local/bin/` is in your `$PATH`. 
                * This is usually set by `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` depending on your shell.
                * You can check by issuing `echo $PATH`, and looking for that entry between `:`'s.
        * For Windows:
            * As long as you installed Python with Pip, this should be a non-issue
        * Done!
        ### Source-install:
        * `git clone https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/Remind`
        * `cd Remind && pip3 install .`
        * You need to make sure that `~/.local/bin/` is in your `$PATH`. 
            * This is usually set by `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` depending on your shell.
            * You can check by issuing `echo $PATH`, and looking for that entry between `:`'s.
        * Done!
        ### Usage:
