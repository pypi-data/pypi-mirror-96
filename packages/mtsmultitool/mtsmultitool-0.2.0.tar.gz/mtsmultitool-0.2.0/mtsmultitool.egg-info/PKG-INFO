Description: # MultiTech Multitool Utility
        
        Library and command line tool for working with Multitech products.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Command line tool `multitool` has functionality split into subcommands.  To get a list of valid subcommands use `--help`
        or `-h`.  Each subcommand can also be queried for details using `--help`.
        
        ### Examples
        
        Get help:
        ```
        multitool --help
        multitool device --help
        multitool device patch --help
        ```
        
        #### Device Subcommand
        
        The `device` command has tools for packaging device firmware upgrades.
        
        Create a patch for an MDot when the images contain bootloaders:
        ```
        multitool device patch -m -V 4.0.2 -v 4.0.5 -i MTDOT -b mdot_image_4.0.2.bin mdot_image_4.0.5.bin
        ```
        
        Compress an XDot image which does not contain a bootloader and append a CRC32:
        ```
        multitool device compress -m -c -i XDOT xdot_image_4.0.5_application.bin
        ```
        
        Upgrade an mDot over serial with an image that contains a bootloader:
        ```
        multitool device upgrade -b COM3 MTDOT mdot_image_4.0.5.bin
        ```
        
        #### Version Number Format
        
        Version numbers can be four parts.  When specified as rc, beta, or alpha only three parts can be included.
        * 1.2
        * 1.2.3.4
        * 1.2-rc4
        * 1.2-beta4
        * 1.2-alpha4
        
        ## Installation 
        Use PIP to install, the `multitool` executable will be added to the Python scripts directory.
        
        ```
        pip install mtsmultitool
        ```
        ## Change Log
        
        ### v0.2
        * Change device model to series, supported series are MTDOT, MDOT, XDOT, MTQ, and MTQN.
        * Automatically determine application offset for `-b` option based on specified device series.
        * Added ability to upgrade a device over serial, it must have MultiTech's bootloader.
        * Added additional fields to manifest to support future versions of FOTA
        * Added and modified CLI options for changes to manifest
