        Parameters
        ----------
        provider
            The provider object that provides resources for reading and writing data.

        config
            A dictionary that contains the tool configuration.

        Process an opened input connection.

        The method that gets called whenever an input connection is opened.

        When an input connection is opened, it receives metadata. Prior to being
        opened, its metadata is None.

        This method IS called during update-only mode.

        In this method, a Plugin designer should make sure to open any output anchors
        during update-only mode in order to ensure that metadata is properly propagated
        in Designer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        input_connection
            The input connection that was opened.

        This method IS NOT called during update-only mode.

        In this method, a Plugin designer should read from the input connection
        and process the record packet that it produces.

        ----------
        input_connection

        This method IS NOT called during update-only mode.
