Getting Started Guide
---------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started with the Alteryx Core SDK, you need a valid
installation of `Alteryx Designer <https://www.alteryx.com/>`__.

Python version 3.8.5 is required for Alteryx Designer plugins.

Set Up the Development Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to configure your development environment.

Create the Virtual Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get started...

1. Install `Miniconda3 <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__ for your
   system.
2. Once the install is done, open an Anaconda Prompt and create a new virtual environment:
   ``conda create -n ayx_python_sdk python=3.8.5``.
3. Next, activate it: ``conda activate ayx_python_sdk``.

If you are not familiar with Anaconda/Miniconda, visit
`Anaconda Documentation <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/>`__.

Install the Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After you create and activate your virtual environment, pip install the
Alteryx Core SDK pip package. For more information on pip, visit the `pip website <https://pypi.org/>`__.

Use this command to install the SDK:

``pip install ayx-python-sdk``

If you do not already have the Alteryx Plugin CLI, Use this command to install the CLI:

``pip install ayx-plugin-cli``

Create the Ayx Plugin Workspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that the Alteryx Python SDK is installed in your virtual environment
packages, we'll create a new `Plugin Tool Workspace <https://extensibility.pages.git.alteryx.com/ayx-sdks/getting_started.html#glossary>`_ 
with default files ready to go. First create the workspace using the ``sdk-workspace-init`` command.

Use this command:
``ayx_plugin_cli sdk-workspace-init``

This will initialize a workspace to manage all your custom tools and plugins.

To create a new tool, use the ``create-ayx-plugin`` command.

The ``create-ayx-plugin`` command takes these parameters:

	* ``--name``: (Required) The name of the new Plugin tool
	* ``--tool-type``: The type of tool to create.

For this example we'll name our new tool ``MyFirstTool``.
We'll use the tool-type ``single-input-single-output``
parameter to create the new tool with default input and output anchors.

Use this command:

``ayx_plugin_cli create-ayx-plugin``

Workspace Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a workspace is created, a ``ayx_workspace.json`` file is
generated inside of your workspace directory. This file tracks metadata
related to your workspace. By default, you do not need to worry about
this file because it is managed and updated by the CLI commands.

Create Your Production Installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After you have implemented and tested your new Ayx Plugin
Tool, you might want to distribute it to others. In order to do this, you
must create a YXI installer. The Core SDK CLI provides a
command for packaging your workspace and tools into an installer.

Run the ``create-yxi`` command and you'll have a YXI
installer ready for distribution.

After you run the ``create-yxi`` command you will have .yxi file
available for distribution. By default, the name of the YXI produced is
based on the Ayx Plugin Workspace directory name but the default can
be overridden using either the ``--yxi-name`` flag or by modifying the
``yxi_name`` field in the ``ayx_workspace.json`` file. (See the
`Workspace Configurations <https://extensibility.pages.git.alteryx.com/ayx-sdks/getting_started.html#workspace-configurations>`_ section for details).

Build the Ayx Plugin Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `sdk-workspace-init` command sets up the folder structure with a
``backends`` folder, ``ui`` folder, and ``configuration`` folder.
These folders have all the files necessary for Alteryx Designer to integrate
with your plugin.

Next we're going to build your new Ayx Plugin Tool
into Designer, where you can drag it onto the canvas and connect it to
other Designer tools. To build ``MyFirstTool`` into the Designer
application, use the ``designer-install`` command.

Use this command to build MyFirstTool into Designer:

``ayx_plugin_cli designer-install``

**Congratulations!**

You just created your first Alteryx Plugin Tool! You can now open Alteryx Designer and find your new tool in the Tool
Palette.

Ayx Plugin Tool Execution in Designer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When Designer runs a tool, it must look for an engine to use. In the
case of our MyFirstTool Python tool, the engine is itself the *Python
interpreter*. The interpreter is built out of Anaconda and includes all
of the packages indicated in ``requirements.txt``.

The ToolFamily defined in the Config.xml file within the Ayx Plugin
Workspace defines the name of the virtual environment created for all
of your Ayx Plugin Tools. By default, a ToolFamily is set up for
your Ayx Plugin Workspace for all of your tools to use.

The YXI installation package includes all of the
interpreter information so that the Python interpreter can be recreated on
any machine when the tools are installed.

The ``EngineDLLEntryPoint`` within the Config.xml file points to the file
that contains a class definition that inherits from ``Plugin``. This
file can be changed at any time to any Python file as long as it
contains a ``Plugin`` class that registers with the Alteryx Core SDK.

* For a detailed explanation of the Config.xml file, see
  `Tool Configurations <https://extensibility.pages.git.alteryx.com/ayx-sdks/config_xml.html>`_.
* For information on the ``main.py`` file within your Ayx Plugin Tool,
  see `Plugin Code Overview <https://extensibility.pages.git.alteryx.com/ayx-sdks/plugin_code.html>`_.

The Configuration Panel GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Alteryx Core SDK examples provide basic Configuration Panel GUIs,
however, the Core SDK *only* executes the engine (the Python side of
the code). Therefore this Getting Started Guide does not cover Alteryx
UI development. For more information on Configuration Panel GUI
development, see `HTML GUI SDK <https://help.alteryx.com/current/developer-help/html-gui-sdk>`__.

Glossary
~~~~~~~~

-  ``Ayx Plugin Workspace``: YXI development workspace with
   sub-directories for individual Ayx Plugin Tools and plugin tool
   files. The Ayx Plugin Workspace is also used to create the YXI
   installer.
-  ``Ayx Plugin Tool``: An Alteryx Designer custom tool built on the
   Alteryx Core SDK.
-  ``YXI``: Packaging file and directory system for Ayx Plugin Tools.
-  ``Tool Configuration``: XML configuration file used by both the
   Alteryx Core SDK and Alteryx Designer to read metadata regarding the
   structure of the Ayx Plugin Tool.
-  ``Tool Family``: Shared resources for all Ayx Plugin Tools within
   an Ayx Plugin Workspace. Tool Families define the name of the
   virtual environment, indicate to Designer what virtual environmnet
   interpreter to run for the Ayx Plugin Tool, and contain the pip-installed 
   pip packages defined in the ``requirements.txt`` file.
