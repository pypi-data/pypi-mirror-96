Plugin Tool Execution Framework
-----------------------------------

Plugin Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Plugin class is the basis for all Ayx Plugin Tools in the new Core
SDK. The abstract Plugin class provides the required abstract methods
that need to be implemented in order for a tool to interact with the
Alteryx Designer application. These interactions are mediated by the Providers,
which provide simplified interfaces for Designer functionality, and drive
the execution of the Ayx Plugin Tools. For more information on the
execution flow, see `Plugin Lifecycle <https://extensibility.pages.git.alteryx.com/ayx-sdks/plugin_lifecycle.html>`__.

Register the Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every plugin must be registered with the Core SDK after the new Ayx
Plugin Tool class is defined. The Ayx Plugin Tool must implement the
base Plugin class in order for the Core SDK to accept the registered
plugin. The registration process indicates to the Core SDK that the
Plugin exists, what the name of the class is, and provides a means of
driving the Ayx Plugin Tool's execution.

The init Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``__init__`` method in the Ayx Plugin Tool class initializes relevant
properties. It is also the access point for the BaseProvider object to
all of the Plugin methods, so the provider is typically stored as a
class variable in the init method. The init is also the point when
anchors are set from the provider.

The on\_input\_connection\_opened Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``on_input_connection_opened`` method is called when a connection is
established with a plugin's input anchor.

This method receives the ``InputConnectionBase`` object, which contains the metadata information
regarding the input connection. This includes what the fields of the
connection are, the name of the connection, and the max packet size.
This method should only deal with meta-information regarding the input
anchor and input connection (and setting any metadata on the output
anchors if it is known from the input connection's metadata).

The on\_record\_packet Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``on_record_packet`` method is called for each input connection when
the number of records the connection has received reaches the
``max_packet_size`` defined for that connection.

If ``None`` is set for ``max_packet_size`` then all records are accumulated before
``on_record_packet`` is called. This method takes in an
``InputConnectionBase`` which is the connection that has received its
maximum number of records. In this method you call the
``InputConnectionBase.read()`` function, which returns the
RecordPacket with ``max_packet_size`` number of records. The
``RecordPacket`` contains the metadata information and to/from dataframe
methods.

The ``to_dataframe`` method is used on input connections to
convert the records contained in the ``RecordPacket`` object to a
`Pandas DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__.

The ``from_dataframe`` method is used to convert the processed data back to
records that are then pushed to the output anchor.

The on\_complete Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``on_complete`` method is called at the end of the runtime
execution.

This typically does any cleanup required for the Ayx Plugin
Tool or, if the plugin is an Input tool-type, this method is used
to read in the data from the datasource and push it to the output
anchor (since an Input tool-type has no input anchors or connections, and
therefore ``on_input_connection_opened`` and ``on_record_packet`` are
not called).
