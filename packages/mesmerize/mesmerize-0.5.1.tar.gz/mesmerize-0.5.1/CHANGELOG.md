# 0.x.0 (planned)

### New
- Experimental use of the bioformats importer for the Viewer.
- Export lite versions of projects for easier sharing.

# 0.5.1

### Fixed
- Project Browswer will display the offending project column if there is an issue in loading it.
- Index error with importing CNMF files (see #50)

# 0.5.0

### Modified
- `PeakFeatures` node will provide warnings instead of exceptions when there are issues w.r.t. a specific peak, such as missing bases or index errors. The offending peaks are ignored, and the the user is provided with information that they can use to check the offending peaks.

### Fixed
- Windows multiprocess fork issues with CNMF runner modules.
- Use `sklearn~=0.23.1` due to tslearn compatibility
- Use `psutil` v5.8 instead of v5.7 due to issues on the latest version of mac os
- Davies-Bouldin function fixed

# 0.4.1

### Fixed
- Use of scalers in Neural Decompose plot
- ``add_roi()`` method addressing a nonexistent ``viewer`` function for various backend managers.

# 0.4.0

### New
- Bokeh based plots that use a bokeh-based datapoint tracer, still in very early stages
- k-Shape "gridsearch", select a n-partitions range and number of combinations, returns heatmap of all k-Shape runs with inertia values
    NOTE: The gridsearch is not saved when the plot is saved. Only the chosen kshape iteration will be saved. This will be fixed in a future release
- Plot neural dynamics in PCA or LDA space
- PadArrays flowchart node to pad dataframe arrays when sizes don't match, useful when splicing is undesired
- View mean, max, or std projection of caiman motion correction outputs by selecting them from the batch manager

### Modified
- CNME Viewer module uses ``CNMFParams`` when running batch items instead of passing the params are args directly to ``CNMF.__init__()``
- Improved performance when importing a project dataframe in the flowchart
- The project ``curves`` dir is deprecated. Backwards compatibility is maintained
- Project browser supports filtering of list-type columns, such as stimulus/behavioral names
- Use tslearn v0.4
- Lots of bug fixes everywhere
- Fix finding (newer?) CUDA GPUs
- Fix bug with stimtuning plot if only one stim type is present

# 0.3.1

### Modified

- Spacemap plot supports 3D data
- Unlabelled stimulus periods can be excluded for Stimulus Tuning plots

# 0.3.0

### New
- Cross correlation plots with stimulus maps.
- Support for Femtonics .mes and .mesc recordings.
- Segmentation using deep learning via NuSeT.
- Caiman NoRMCorr motion correction can be used for 3D data, just treats each plane as an individual 2D recording
- Caiman 2D CNMF can be used on 3D data, useful if you can assume each cell appears in only 1 plane

### Fixed
- ROI removal is much faster when clearing the work environment
- Bug fix with saving Stimulus Tuning plots
- Unnoticable bug with viewer modules that don't have defined dock areas

# 0.2.3

### Fixed
- Batch Manager view input bug with multiple viewers.
- Transmission.from_proj() bug spiking data are None.

### Modified
- Transmissions spawned from Load_Proj_DF node no longer have the ``last_output`` attribute set to ``"_RAW_CURVE"``. This allows the ``"_DFOF"`` and ``"_SPIKES"`` data to be used immediately with certain nodes.
- Units combobox for stimulus mapping module is disabled.
- Doc links in Help menus now point to the online docs for the current Mesmerize version instead of having built-in docs.

# 0.2.2

### Fixed
- Heatmap plot widget properly handles live updates from input data
- Saving of Stimulus tuning curve plots
- Stimulus plots is faster since linear regions aren't redrawn for the same stimulus type.
- Curve plot now shows up when the sample is opened via the datapoint tracer.

### Modified
- Tuning curve plot widget returns stimulus xlabels and yvals to separate dataframe columns instead of being together in one column as a list.
- tslearn and bottleneck are optional dependencies.

# 0.2.1

### Fixed
- Changed default python call in system config for Windows to be ``python`` instead of ``python3``.

# 0.2.0

### New
- Mesmerize can now be installed via pip.
- Create stimulus tuning curve plots.
- ΔF/F must now be extracted at the Viewer stage for caiman data, or set through other methods. Spikes and ΔF/F can be visualized in the Viewer.
- Windows is now supported!
- The Viewer can handle 3D data and 3D ROIs.
- For development, classes are provided for creating Volumetic ROI types, and a Volumetic ROI manager.
- Caiman 3D CNMF is supported.
- CNMF(E) data can be imported directly from hdf5 files from Caiman. Therefore you can use your own scripts/notebooks and existing CNMF hdf5 files for downstream analysis in Mesmerize.
- Suite2p importer added, allowing you to perform downstream analysis of Suite2p output data in Mesmerize.

### Modified
- Much easier to import imaging meta data from other sources, users can just add a function to ``mesmerize.viewer.core.organize_metadata``.
- Updated CNMF(E) and motion correction modules to use the latest release of CaImAn. Parameter entry GUIs are much more flexible now.
- More customizable support for use of caiman modules within the Mesmerize viewer's script editor.
- Some API cleanup with the batch manager
