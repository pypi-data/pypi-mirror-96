## Background

A Python interface to [Textile](https://textile.io/)'s [Powergate](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/) [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) API. See the project [website](http://pygate.tech) for more details.

## Install

You can get started using `pygate_grpc` by installing it through the PyPi repository.

```
pip install pygate_grpc
```

## Usage

The main component of the package is the `PowerGateClient` class.

Here is a basic usage example of the pygate_grpc:

```python
from pygate_grpc.client import PowerGateClient

client = PowerGateClient("127.0.0.1:5002", is_secure=False)

build_info = client.build_info()
```

Simple as that!

Note: this examples assumes you have a Powergate server running with an API available at `127.0.0.1:5002`. See Textile's Powergate [Localnet](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/localnet/). The `is_secure=False` flag indicates that SSL is not enabled on this server.

Examples of more elaborated usage can be found in the [examples](./examples/)  folder.

# Contributing

Please read contribution [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting development.

To setup your development environment make sure you have the following software:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) ( or run `pip install pipenv`)

## Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/pygate/pygate-gRPC.git
```

## Install dependencies

The runtime and development dependencies can be installed in a new virtual environment automatically by running the following command in the project root directory:

```
pipenv install --dev
```

NOTE: The `--dev` flag can be ommited if you only need runtime dependencies

### **Using the virtual environment**

To run any command through pipenv's virtual environment you can spawn a new virtual environment shell by running:

```
pipenv shell
```

## Code Style

This project uses [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) code formatter for consistency. Since the are not any precommit hooks defined in the repository yet please format your code before opening a pull request.

Automatic formatting can be performed by running:
```
pipenv run format
```

## Running the tests

Currently the test suite is very minimal. Full Testing is in the project's roadmap but it will be developed only if the timeframe of the Hackathon allows to do so.

### **Integration Tests**

Integration tests spin up a localnet using the official script from powergate repository and the test cases are run using that network. By implication, to run the test make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- docker-compose
- docker
- git

To run the integration tests run:

```
pipenv run integration-test
```

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/apogiatzis/powsolver/tags).

To automatically bump the version of the package run:
```
bump2version major|minor|patch setup.py
```

Finally, to push the new version to git and trigger a new release action it is necessary to add the `--tags` flag at the time of pushing. i.e.:
```
git push origin main --tags
```
