# Prose

An unpoetic version of [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

While the Poetry package is elegant and reduces a Python developers burden, every day usage has some small annoyances. Some of these things could be fixed but have been considered out of scope and unpoetic.

Prose is made to be the everyday version of Poetry and little bit more trashy. But the trashiness serves those well in the dirty jobs of life. Prose is a wrapper around Poetry so all commands and APIs should function the same with the addition of more features.

## Installation

```
pip install trashy-poetry
```

## Usage

Substitute all `poetry` commands for `prose`.

See [Poetry Docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). All commands and APIs function the same except for the additional features documented.

For Example:

```
poetry init -> prose init

poetry shell -> prose shell
```

## Features

### Hardcoded Environmental Variables

Inject environmental variables into the `run` and `shell` commands by hard coding them into you `pyproject.toml` file.

**Example:**

```
[tool.prose.env]
TEST_ENV = "hello world"
TEST_PATH = "${PATH}:/narf"
```

Any variables set in the `tool.prose.env` section of your toml file will be injected into the environment for you.
