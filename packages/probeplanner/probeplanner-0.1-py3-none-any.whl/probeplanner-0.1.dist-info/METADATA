# Probe planner

**CAUTION**: this project is in alpha stage. The docs are incomplete and it is bound to change in the future. Use at your own risk.

A tool to help plan where to implant electrodes, plobes and fibers.

It visualizes the probe given the location of it's tip (in AP/ML/DV coordinates expressed micrometers) and it's angles (relative to the ML and AP plane, as you'd tilt a stereotax).
As the probe is moved around this application displays which brain regions the probe is going through.
