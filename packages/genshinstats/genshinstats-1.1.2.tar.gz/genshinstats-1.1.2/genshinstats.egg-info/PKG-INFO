Description: # genshin stats api
        This project is meant to be a wrapper for the [hoyolab.com](https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/) gameRecord api.
        I have attempted to reverse engineer their API to find out the important tokens and cookies and then to what urls they are sent.
        You can pip install with [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/genshinstats/)
        
        # how to use
        Import the `genshin_stats` module and do `set_cookie(...)` to login.
        You can either use `set_cookie(account_id=..., cookie_token=...)`.
        The cookie is required and will raise an error if missing.
        All functions are documented and type hinted.
        ## example
        Simple example of usage:
        ```py
        import genshinstats as gs # import module
        gs.set_cookie(account_id=8366222, cookie_token="zHbPk8BO3FG4hEOFD2aO6ZlGR1vF75ipuTmFyi2w") # login
        result = gs.search('sadru') # search a community user
        uid = gs.get_uid_from_community(result['users'][1]['uid']) # get the uid fro the results
        user_info = gs.get_user_info(uid) # get user info with the uid
        total_characters = len(user_info['avatars']) # get the list of characters, called avatars in the basic API
        print('user "sadru" has a total of',total_characters,'characters')
        ```
        > the cookie token in this example is not valid, you must use your own.
        ## prettifiers
        There are prettifier functions that turn data into a pretty version.
        This is to rename some fields that don't make sense, like fetters.
        These are highly recommended.
        ```py
        characters = gs.prettify_characters(gs.get_all_characters(uid))
        for char in characters:
            print(f"{char['rarity']}* {char['name']:10} Level: {char['level']} C{char['constellation']}")
        ```
        
        # how to get your cookie
        1. go to [hoyolab.com](https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/)
        2. login to your account
        3. open inspect mode (Developer Tools)
        4. go to `Application`, `Cookies`, `https://www.hoyolab.com`.
        5. copy `account_id` and `cookie_token`
        6. use `set_cookie(account_id=..., cookie_token=...)` in your code
