# S3 Command Line Utility

### Credentials

First of all, you will need to have your credentials ready.
The following are needed (next to them are the names of the environmental variables associated to them):

- Endpoint `ENDPOINT`
- Access Key `ACCESS_KEY`
- Secret Access Key `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- Bucket `BUCKET`
- OPTIONALLY: if you have an HTTP prefix for accessing keys over a web browser you can add it with the `HTTP_PREFIX` variable

In order to avoid having to introduce your credentials after every command execution it is possible to store them as environmental variables.
You can even do this temporarily setting a variables as `export ENDPOINT_URL=MyURL`. This way, your credentials will only be set for the current terminal.

### Operations

The following operations are possible:

- Listing all keys in a bucket
- Listing keys according to a prefix in a bucket
- Change key permissions to public-read
- Upload any number of keys. Is Multithreaded.
- Download any number of keys. Is Multithreaded.
- Delete keys. Is Multithreaded.
