Description:
        Nucleus is a library of Python and C++ code designed to make it easy to
        read, write and analyze data in common genomics file formats like SAM and VCF.
        In addition, Nucleus enables painless integration with the TensorFlow machine
        learning framework, as anywhere a genomics file is consumed or produced, a
        TensorFlow tfrecords file may be substituted.
