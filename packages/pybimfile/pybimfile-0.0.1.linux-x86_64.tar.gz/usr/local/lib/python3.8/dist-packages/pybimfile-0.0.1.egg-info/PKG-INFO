        # pybimfile - before image file (BIM File) - copy on write
        
        `pybimfile` implements [`copy-on-write`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) 
        for file based resources
        
        before a change to a file is written all changes are recorded in another file.
        
        
        # memory / file layout
        
        ## header
        
        | name | size (bytes) | description |
        | --- | --- | --- | 
        | blen | xpos | original size of file prior changes |
        | mark | xpos | 0xdeafbeef as start marker |
        | magick | 4 | 0xdeafbeef as magic marker |
        
        ## change record
        
        | name | size / value | description |
        | --- | --- | --- | 
        | fpos | xpos | pointer to file change |
        | blen | xpos | size of change segment |
        | magick | 4 | 0xdeafbeef as magic marker |
        
        a list of change records is stored as continuously stream after header
        
        
        ## limitation
        
        - xpos (default) == 8 bytes ==> 2**(8*8) 
        == 18.446.744.073.709.551.616 bytes total file size (default)
        - the default can be changed by creating `BeforeImageFile` with a different `link_size`
        - 
        
        # remarks
        
        this module is derived (refactored) from another tool by myself named `LargeFileGuard` in 
        [`pyfileguard`](https://github.com/kr-g/pyfileguard) and intendend to be used together with
        [`pyheapfile`](https://github.com/kr-g/pyheapfile/) related software modules
        
        
        # Platform
        
        Tested on Python3, and Linux.
        
        
        # development status
        
        alpha state.
        the API or logical call flow might change without prior notice.
        
        read [`CHANGELOG`](https://github.com/kr-g/pybimfile/blob/main/CHANGELOG.MD)
        for latest, or upcoming news.
