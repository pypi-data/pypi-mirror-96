Thanks for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!

Here's a quick checklist that should be present in PRs:

- [ ] Make sure to include one or more tests for your change
- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS`
- [ ] Add a new entry to the `doc/source/CHANGELOG` (choose any open position to avoid merge conflicts with other PRs).
      Decide whether your change is a fix or a new feature.
