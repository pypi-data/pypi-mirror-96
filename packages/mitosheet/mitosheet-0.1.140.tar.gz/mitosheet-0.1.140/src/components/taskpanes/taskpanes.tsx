    Each Taskpane has a type (included TaskpaneType.NONE, which is the type of _no taskpane_ (e.g. nothing is displayed)).

    If you want to be able to open a taskpane in Mito, then you need to add the type of this taskpane, 
    as well as any parameters it has, to this type.

    For example, if you create a new taskpane 'Dork' that takes a columnHeader as input, then you should
    add a new element here that looks like:
        | {type: 'TaskpaneType.DORK', columnHeader: string}
