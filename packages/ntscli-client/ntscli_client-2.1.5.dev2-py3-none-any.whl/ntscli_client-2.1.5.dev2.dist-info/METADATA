# ntscli-client

# Requirements

* python 3.6 or later with matching pip
* NTS-CLI compatible SSL configuration

# Install

## Installing on the OS python:

Ubuntu only: You might need to install pip3 on Ubuntu if you haven't already:

`sudo apt install -y python3-pip`

Then this only requires python 3.6 or later, which is already installed on Ubuntu 18.04 and later, and macOS Catalina.

`pip3 install -U ntscli-client`

Ubuntu only: Ubuntu doesn't set up the user PATH to include the local user's python binary path. 
You might have to do something like this if you can't find `nts` after install:

```
echo "export PATH=\"$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin:$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

# Install your security certificate

You still need a [security certificate, as documented here](https://docs.nrd.netflix.com/docs/nrdp/cert/ntscli/requesting-a-certificate/). 
Once it's a decrypted zip file, you can now install it pretty easily with this tool:

`nts ssl install ~/Downloads/cloud.zip`

Manually moving it to ~/.config/netflix/cloud/(files) still works as well.

# Update Often

Use the same pip3 command, but especially for the first little while there will probably be frequent updates.

We suggest updating frequently anyway. For instance, for docker images or CI systems, you can install/update every time the image is 
created or run. If a released update to the RAE requires matching client or client library updates, you would not require any additional 
work to take the update.

## Versioning

We will be following standard python semantic versioning, so if you really want to pin versions, you can follow standard python practices:

```shell script
pip3 install ntscli-client<=3.0.0  # don't accidentally pick up a new major version, which could include breaking changes
pip3 install ntscli-client==0.1.4  # a specific older version
pip3 install ntscli-client>=0.1.5  # anything after a specific version
```

# Enjoy

`nts --help`

```shell script
export RAE=r3000334
export ESN=$(nts get-devices | jq -r 'map(.esn)[0]')  # actually just the first ESN I find
# or for powershell:
$env:RAE = 'r3000334'
$env:ESN = 'NFANDROID2-PRV-SHIELDANDROIDTV-NVIDISHIELD=ANDROID=TV-15895-BB9C5AF4E97B69BC1A51654A94304D3AD88169C2BA2F1338192C20E940AE669E'

nts get-plan  # prints to stdout

# get a plan dynamically
nts run --names AUDIO-001-TC1,ACT-004-TC11
# get a plan and run it immediately
nts get-plan | nts run --names AUDIO-001-TC1,ACT-004-TC11
# save the plan via shell redirection
nts get-plan > full_plan.json

# save the plan with an arg instead
nts get-plan --save-to full_plan.json

# Choosing what to run

## Just at run:
nts run --names AUDIO-001-TC1,ACT-004-TC11  # gets the test plan first, then filters
nts run --testplan full_plan.json --names AUDIO-001-TC1,ACT-004-TC11  # saves you the 1-2 minutes getting the test plan if you already have one

## using files
nts get-plan --save-to full_plan.json
cat full_plan.json | jq -r '{target: .target, testplan: {branch: .testplan.branch, sdkVersion: .testplan.sdkVersion, testcases: [.testplan.testcases[] | select(.category | startswith("Config"))] }}' > filtered_plan.json
cat filtered_plan.json | nts run 

## built-in filtering command
nts get-plan --save-to full_plan.json
nts filter --help
nts filter --names AUDIO-001-TC1 < full_plan.json > filtered_plan.json
nts filter --names AUDIO-001-TC1 --testplan full_plan.json --save-to filtered_plan.json
nts filter --names-re "AUDIO.*TC3" full_plan.json --save-to filtered_plan.json
nts get-plan | nts filter --eyepatch --tags batch | nts run

## DIY Filtering using external tools, if you -really- want to
CURRENT_EPOCH=$(date +%s) 
nts get-plan | jq -r '{target: .target, testplan: {branch: .testplan.branch, sdkVersion: .testplan.sdkVersion, testcases: [.testplan.testcases[] | select(.category | startswith("Config"))] }}' | nts run 2>${CURRENT_EPOCH}.stderr.txt > ${CURRENT_EPOCH}.json 
```

#### Features

* JSON goes to stdout, logging goes to stderr: `nts get-devices > device_list.json`
* Typical shell exit codes for commands, mean you can use shell checks such as: `nts get-devices || echo FAIL`
* Multi-OS, multi-shell compatible
* Tab completion available (see `nts completion show --help`)
* Available via PYPI, using standard versioning


## Alternative Installs

#### Pre-release installs:

`pip3 install -U ntscli-client --pre`

If Netflix posts a pre-release that might include a bug fix specifically for you, you might be asked to try this.

#### Install for any user of the OS (generally discouraged):

`sudo pip3 install -U ntscli-client`

If you are managing a server that might have lots of users that need the same install, this might be a good solution if you don't prefer
using an alternate abstraction such as a virtual environment, conda environment, etc.

### Installing in an isolation environment

Python is well known for isolation environments like virtualenv, conda, pyenv, etc. These all work, and you should have no trouble using these if you prefer.
