        `EasyBuild <https://easybuilders.github.io/easybuild>`_ is a software build
        and installation framework that allows you to manage (scientific) software
        on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in an efficient way.
        
        The **easybuild-framework** package is the core of EasyBuild. It
        supports the implementation and use of so-called easyblocks which
        implement the software install procedure for a particular (group of) software
        package(s).
        
        The EasyBuild documentation is available at http://easybuild.readthedocs.org/.
        
        The EasyBuild framework source code is hosted on GitHub, along
        with an issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests, see
        https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework.
