        ## A Python interface for SCHISM model runs.
        
        ### Installation:
        
        It is highly recommended that you run this software using a [Python virtual environment](https://gist.github.com/jreniel/c2dd4f2f68f9d8172355461b5337f236), and that you use Python>=3.6 (preferrably, using the latest available Python version is encouraged). You may use conda or venv to satisfy this dependency.
        
        To install, clone this repository, and navigate into it:
        ``` bash
        git clone https://github.com/schism-dev/pyschism
        cd pyschism
        ```
        Then make sure to activate the target Python environment (this step is not necessary if you chose not to use a virtual environment).
        After making sure your target environment is active, you can install the package using pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install .
        ```
        If you are a developer, you  may install in developer mode instead:
        ```bash
        pip install -e .
        ```

        ### Usage examples:
        
        #### Using the CLI
        ##### Example 1: Full domain hgrid plot from the terminal.
        ``` bash
        plot_mesh /path/to/hgrid.gr3 --plot-boundaries --plot-elements
        ```
        ![example_1_hgrid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schism-dev/pyschism/master/examples/example_1/hgrid.png)
        
        #### Using the Library
        Hint: You can test the library functions from the command line (without having to write a .py file) by using `python -c` and wrapping the commands between a pair of quotes, for example:
        ```bash
        python -c "
        from pyschism.mesh import Hgrid
        print(Hgrid.open('/path/to/hgrid.gr3'))
        "
        ```
        ##### Example 1: Full domain Hgrid plot:
        ``` python
        from pyschism.mesh import Hgrid
        hgrid = Hgrid.open('hgrid.gr3')
        hgrid.make_plot(show=True)
        ```
        ##### Example 2: Write boundaries to shapefile
        ```python
        # open mesh as example above
        from pyschism.mesh import Hgrid
        hgrid = Hgrid.open('hgrid.gr3', crs="EPSG:3395")  # For shapefile output, coordinate reference system should be specified.
        hgrid.write_boundaries("/path/to/output/dir", overwrite=True)
        ```
        
        ##### Example 3: Write mesh to QGIS friendly format
        ```python
        # NOTE: 2dm files can be read by QGIS > 3.0
        from pyschism.mesh import Hgrid
        hgrid = Hgrid.open('hgrid.gr3')
        hgrid.write("/path/to/output/file.2dm", fmt='2dm')
        ```
