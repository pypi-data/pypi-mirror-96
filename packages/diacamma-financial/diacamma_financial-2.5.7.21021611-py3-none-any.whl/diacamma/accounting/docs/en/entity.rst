	**General case**

Let us in the menu *Financial/Bookkeeping/accounting entries*.

From this screen, we have the ability to view the scriptures
previously entered as well as add new ones.

As you can see in this screen, you can view entries
by newspapers or by state. 5 Status filters are available:

* All: no filtering is applied

* Validated: validated only DEJE writings
* Scholar: only close or lettered entries avecd'autres
* No scholar: only entries not yet literate

And 5 default journals:
* Purchasing Journal
* Sales Journal
* Cash Received Journal
* Journal of various operations
* last fiscal year report journal

To add an entry, first select which start with
newspaper we want to achieve our new writing, and then we click *Add the button*.

After having specified the dates of your writing, you must
add different lines corresponding é your financial transaction.

To add a writing line, enter the account code
if you know in the Add line or leave your guide
the wizard by clicking the button for the desired account.

The tool will not allow you to validate your writing if it is unbalanced.

When one begins in accounting, sometimes it's hard to know if a line is debit or credit. To help, message
warns you if you have entered a refund or credit and a button allow you to reverse your writing very easily if necessary.

	**Making a payoff**

A write cashing can manually input as before but often a settlement completes a purchase or a sale made more tét few days.

To simplify your entry, reopen the write call or put you want to enter the settlement, click on the "Receipt" button: the application then offers a new writing
partially filled. It only remains for you E. specify on which financial account (cash, bank ...) you want to perform this operation.

Once a validated cashing via this mechanism, the two scripts (that of buying or selling and the collection) are automatically lettered.

	**Last fiscal year report**

The new journal is to carry only be modified in the initialization phase of your exercise.

At this time, you can be required to perform specific operations such as the distribution of profits for the year
previous next several accounts.

By cons, in this paper, it is not possible to add lines scriptures loads or products.

Lettering of entities
---------------------

As we mentioned in a previous chapter, it is regular
a set of entries refer to one or more operations
municipalities. In this case, you can mark these scriptures as
linked: you will then lettrer them.

Most often, lettering
is realized between complementary third value entries: between
Writing a purchase (or sale) and its associated collection.

But it may happen that we wanted more than two letters
writings. For example, you may want to set a 3 bills
provider at once. In this case, as you are one
cheque only an amount equal the sum é bills, you will
a write collection that you will letter with 3
shopping scriptures. A replay of your accounting, it will become
so easy to understand that this was a multiple regulation.

To perform this action, select the entries you want
link and click the "Letter" button: If the considered tool
being consistent, he will realize lettering symbolized by a number
é common these writings in the last column of the newspaper.

If you click this button again, you can delete
the lettering of this writing and the associated paperwork.

Validation of entity
--------------------

By default, a script is entered in the fog, it is said in an e
state it remains editable or deletable.

By cons, it is necessary to finalize your accounting, to validate this
write to endorse your input.

To perform this action, select the entries and controlled
click the "Submit" button: The application then assign a
number to your writings and the date of validation.

Once validated, writing becomes unchangeable: this mechanism provides
intangible and irreversible character of your accounting.
Since to err is human, instead of deleting a write validation, you will need
create a reverse writing to cancel.

This is useful for an accountant responsible to clarify that this
Writing is checked against the associated justification.
This also serves, in the case of collections of writings, to check that
this revenue or expense face well on a bank statement.

To close a fiscal year, all entries must be validated.

Entity Search
-------------

From the list of entries, the "Search" button allows you
define search criteria accounting entries.

all corresponding entries to these criteria. You can then
print this list or edit/writing.
