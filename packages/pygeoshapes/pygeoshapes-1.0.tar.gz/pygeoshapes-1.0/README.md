Thanks for downloading this package!

Use this packege to draw geometric shapes by using stars

This package can draw a Butterfly, an Equilateral Triangle, an Right Angled Triangle and a kite 

Each shape has a class that can draw it!
Just call the class! The class takes two arguments(int(even or odd) number) and after that it draws a shape base on the number

Enjoy!
