The Neurokernel Project was begun in July 2011 by 
`Aurel A. Lazar <http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~aurel/>`_ at 
Columbia University's Department of Electrical Engineering after extensive 
discussions held during a `research seminar on Massively Parallel Neural 
Computation <http://www.bionet.ee.columbia.edu/courses/EEBM_E9070/2012>`_. The 
Neurokernel Development Team currently comprises the
