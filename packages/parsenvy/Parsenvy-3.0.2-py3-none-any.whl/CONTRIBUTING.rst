Got a problem?
===============

You're welcome to `create an issue <https://github.com/nkantar/Parsenvy/issues/new>`_, but please `search existing ones <https://github.com/nkantar/Parsenvy/issues>`_ first to see if it's been discussed before.


Want to submit some code or docs?
==================================

Great!
If you're intersted in tackling an `existing issue <https://github.com/nkantar/Parsenvy/issues>`_, comment on one to make sure you're on the right track.
If it's an idea you have or a problem not captured in an issue, `create one <https://github.com/nkantar/Parsenvy/issues/new>`_ and let's align.


Dev setup
----------

Requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_

Once you have those two, install project dependencies with:

.. code-block:: bash

   poetry install

At this point you should be able to make changes to the codebase and run things.

Speaking of running things, there are a number of code quality checks that get run on every pull request.
You are encouraged to run them locally as you work for a much faster feedback loop.

   * - Command
     - What it does
   * - `make formatcheck`
     - Run the `black` formatter with the `--check` flag to validate the source is formatted correctly.
   * - `make lint`
     - Run the `flake8` linter to validate there are no linter errors in the source.
   * - `make doccheck`
     - Run the `pydocstyle` docstring format checker to validate the docstrings are complete and standardized. *Currently disabled*.
   * - `make docs`
     - Run the Sphinx documentation site builder to validate the docs build successfully.
   * - `make typecheck`
     - Run the `mypy` type checker to validate the type annotations are valid. *Currently disabled*.
   * - `make test`
     - Run tests to validate they all pass.
   * - `make covcheck`
     - Calculate test coverage to validate all code paths are executed at least once.


Docstring standards
-------------------

The project uses the `Google style <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_ of docstrings.
