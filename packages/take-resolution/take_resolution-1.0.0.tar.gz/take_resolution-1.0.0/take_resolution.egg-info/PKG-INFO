Description: # Take Resolution
        
        This package proposes to offer a rate that represents the user resolution on the smart contact. 
        
        The proposal considers that users have resolution every time they receive a service provided by the smart contact. The rate is a value between 0 and 1 and as closer to 1, the better the rate is.
        
        If the metric is:
          * 1: all users receive had at least one resolution on the smart contact
          * 0: all users didn't had at least one resolution on the smart contact
        
        # Installation
        Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/take-resolution/) to install:
        
        ```shell script
        pip install take-resolution
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        ## Using a **numeric scale** Consumer Satisfaction Survey:
        
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        import take_resolution as tr
        
        df = pd.DataFrame(
            {"amount": [11198, 11310, 11164, 10571, 11277, 7903, 4968],
            "DAUs": [13487, 13859, 12979, 12342, 17030, 9631, 6099]})
        
        result = tr.run(dataframe=pd,
                        amount="amount",
                        dau_column="DAUs")
        
        print(result["rate"])
        ```
        
        Which will result in `0.7665976833542061`.
