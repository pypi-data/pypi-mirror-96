        a chemical element. It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus. In

        The mass of an atom. Although the SI unit of mass is kilogram, the atomic

        1 dalton is defined as ​1⁄12 of the mass of a single carbon-12 atom, at rest.
        The protons and neutrons of the nucleus account for nearly all of the total
        mass of atoms, with the electrons and nuclear binding energy making minor
        contributions. Thus, the numeric value of the atomic mass when expressed
        in daltons has nearly the same value as the mass number.

        The atomic radius of a chemical element is a measure of the size of its atoms,
        usually the mean or typical distance from the center of the nucleus to the
        boundary of the surrounding shells of electrons. Since the boundary is not
        a well-defined physical entity, there are various non-equivalent definitions
        of atomic radius. Three widely used definitions of atomic radius are: 
        
        - Van der Waals Radius
        - Ionic Radius
        - Covalent Radius

        This property returns the covalent radius in Å (angstrom), which is one
        ten-billionth of a meter (0.000_000_000_1 m) or 1/10th of a nanometer.

        another term is required to describe the various forms, and the term phase
        is used. Each distinct form is called a phase; however, the concept of phase
        defined as a homogeneous portion of a system extends beyond a single material,
        because a phase may also involve several materials. For example, a homogeneous
        solution of any number of substances is a one-phase system.
