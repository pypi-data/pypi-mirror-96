mock_cisco.py is a Cisco IOS mock up as a proof of concept for testing 
interactive screen scrapers; I intended it to work well with several 
parallel scrapers hitting it at once.

However, it seems that the MockSSH library isn't up to the task as of MockSSH
version 1.4.2.  I saw strange behavior when I tried to enable with three 
parallel ssh sessions at once.  Nevertheless, it's an interesting proof of 
concept, so I'm leaving it in the repo.

To run it...

- Use Python 2.7
- Install MockSSH
- python path/to/mock_cisco.py

By default, it listens for ssh on port 2222, the login credentials are:

- Username: admin
- Password: cisco
- Enable: cisco123

The commands it mocks are:

- enable
- term len 0 (there is no paging, but it won't burp when you enter this)
- sh ip int brief
- show ver
