# Release Notes

## 0.8.0 - 2021-02-24

This version adds conditional sampling for tabular models by combining a reject-sampling
strategy with the native conditional sampling capabilities from the gaussian copulas.

It also introduces several upgrades on the HMA1 algorith that improve data quality and
robustness in the multi-table scenarios by making changes in how the parameters of the child
tables are aggregated on the parent tables, including a complete rework of how the correlation
matrices are modeled and rebuild after sampling.

### Issues resolved

* Fix probabilities contain NaN error - Issue [#326](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/326) by @csala
* Conditional Sampling for tabular models - Issue [#316](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/316) by @fealho and @csala

## 0.7.0 - 2021-01-27

This release introduces a few changes in the HMA1 relational algorithm to decrease modeling
and sampling times, while also ensuring that correlations are properly kept across tables
and also adding support for some relational schemas that were not supported before.

A few changes in constraints and tabular models also ensure that situations that produced
errors before now work without errors.

to ensure that SDV works properly on Windows Systems, making this the first
release to be officially supported on Windows.

Apart from this, some more internal changes have been made to solve a few minor
issues from the older versions while also improving the processing speed when
processing relational datasets with the default parameters.

### API breaking changes

* The `distribution` argument of the `GaussianCopula` has been renamed to `field_distributions`.
* The `HMA1` and `SDV` classes now use the `categorical_fuzzy` transformer by default instead of
  the `one_hot_encoding` one.

## 0.4.5 - 2020-10-17

In this version a new family of models for Synthetic Time Series Generation is introduced
under the `sdv.timeseries` sub-package. The new family of models now includes a new class
called `PAR`, which implements a *Probabilistic AutoRegressive* model.

This version also adds support for composite primary keys and regex based generation of id
fields in tabular models and drops Python 3.5 support.

### Issues resolved

* Drop python 3.5 support - [Issue #204](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/204) by @csala

## 0.4.4 - 2020-10-06

This version adds a new tabular model based on combining the CTGAN model with the reversible
transformation applied in the GaussianCopula model that converts random variables with
arbitrary distributions to new random variables with standard normal distribution.

The reversible transformation is handled by the GaussianCopulaTransformer recently added to RDT.

### Issues resolved

* Add CopulaGAN Model - [Issue #202](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/202) by @csala

## 0.4.3 - 2020-09-28

This release moves the models and algorithms related to generation of synthetic
relational data to a new `sdv.relational` subpackage (Issue #198)

As part of the change, also the old `sdv.models` have been removed and now
relational model is based on the recently introduced `sdv.tabular` models.

## 0.4.2 - 2020-09-19

In this release the `sdv.evaluation` module has been reworked to include 4 different
metrics and in all cases return a normalized score between 0 and 1.

Included metrics are:
- `cstest`
- `kstest`
- `logistic_detection`
- `svc_detection`

## 0.4.1 - 2020-09-07

This release fixes a couple of minor issues and introduces an important rework of the
User Guides section of the documentation.

### Issues fixed

* Error Message: "make sure the Graphviz executables are on your systems' PATH" - [Issue #182](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/182) by @csala
* Anonymization mappings leak - [Issue #187](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/187) by @csala

## 0.4.0 - 2020-08-08

In this release SDV gets new documentation, new tutorials, improvements to the Tabular API
and broader python and dependency support.

Complete list of changes:

* New Documentation site based on the `pydata-sphinx-theme`.
* New User Guides and Notebook tutorials.
* New Developer Guides section within the docs with details about the SDV architecture,
  the ecosystem libraries and how to extend and contribute to the project.
* Improved API for the Tabular models with focus on ease of use.
* Support for Python 3.8 and the newest versions of pandas, scipy and scikit-learn.
* New Slack Workspace for development discussions and community support.

## 0.3.6 - 2020-07-23

This release introduces a new concept of `Constraints`, which allow the user to define
special relationships between columns that will not be handled via modeling.

This is done via a new `sdv.constraints` subpackage which defines some well-known pre-defined
constraints, as well as a generic framework that allows the user to customize the constraints
to their needs as much as necessary.

### New Features

* Support for Constraints - [Issue #169](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/169) by @csala


## 0.3.5 - 2020-07-09

This release introduces a new subpackage `sdv.tabular` with models designed specifically
for single table modeling, while still providing all the usual conveniences from SDV, such
as:

* Seamless multi-type support
* Missing data handling
* PII anonymization

Currently implemented models are:

* GaussianCopula: Multivariate distributions modeled using copula functions. This is stronger
  version, with more marginal distributions and options, than the one used to model multi-table
  datasets.
* CTGAN: GAN-based data synthesizer that can generate synthetic tabular data with high fidelity.
