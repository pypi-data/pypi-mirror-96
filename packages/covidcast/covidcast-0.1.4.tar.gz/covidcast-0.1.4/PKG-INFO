Description: # COVIDcast API client
        
        Provides Python access to the [COVIDcast
        API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html) published
        by the [Delphi group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon

        cases, deaths, symptom surveys, healthcare data, and other information. This
        package also provides convenient tools for mapping and analyzing the API's data.
