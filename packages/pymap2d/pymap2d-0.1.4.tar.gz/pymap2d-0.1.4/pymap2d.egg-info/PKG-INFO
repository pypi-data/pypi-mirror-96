Description: # pymap2d
        
        Map2D is a simple python 2D gridmap class,
        able to load 2d maps from ROS .yaml/.pgm maps.
        
        Map2D provides:
        - simple xy <-> ij coordinate conversions,
        - implementation of the dijkstra algorithm.
        - 2D ESDF calculation
        
        CMap2D is a Cython-based performance optimized version of Map2D,
        providing fast 2D ESDF calculation from occupancy grids.
