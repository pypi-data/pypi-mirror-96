"""
Creating publication-ready figures
==================================

While the ad-hoc settings of skultrafast are generally fine, some
additional adjustment may be necessary to create figures for an article.
Here, in this tutorial will the most common steps. If you think anything
is missing or wrong, don't hesitate to submit an issue or pull-request.
If you looking for way to do something, please also have a look at the
`matplotlib documentation <https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/index.html>`__. 
It contains many examples and multiple tutorials.

\*\ **tl;dr**

Call ``plot_helpers.enable_style()`` before creating your figures.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skultrafast import data_io, dataset
wl, t, d = data_io.load_example()
ds = dataset.TimeResSpec(wl, t, d)
ds.auto_plot = False 
cds = ds.estimate_dispersion("gauss_diff").correct_ds
wls = (500, 5550, 590, 620, 630, 670)

# %%
# Figure size
# -----------
# _Use the journal supplied figure size_
#
# The most important step is to get the figure size correct. By default,
# matplotlib creates a 4 in by 3 in figure (1 in = 2.54 cm) which is a reasonable
# size for the screen but unsuitably large on paper. If the figure is just
# manually scaled down after creation, the font-size is too small and
# other small details like ticks may be not recognizable anymore.


fig, ax = plt.subplots()
cds.plot.trans(*wls,  ax=ax)

# %%
# Instead, most journals author guidelines give values for the maximum width of
# figures, use them. It is not always necessary to use the full
# width, sometimes its okay to leave some free space. As a rule of thump, a
# single column figure should have width of around 3.5 in, a two column figure
# about 7.5".

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3.5, 3.5*(3/4))) # Figure with the same 4:3 ratio
cds.plot.trans(*wls,  ax=ax)

# %%
# If the figure is too small on screen, which is often the case in the
# Jupyter-notebook, resist the urge to make the figure larger. Instead, increase
# the dpi of the figure. The matplotlib defaults of 100 dpi are quite low
# compared to modern screens. Desktop-screens often have around 144 dpi and
# laptop screens can get up 230 dpi.

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3.5, 3.5*(3/4)), dpi=144) # Figure with the same 4:3 ratio
cds.plot.trans(*wls, ax=ax)

# %%
# Still the figure looks a little bit toy-like. This is partly caused by the
# default font-size of matplotlib, which is to large for most publications.
# Before we continue, we save the changes we did so far as a default and also
# change the default font size. Most journals have guidelines for the font size
# in figures, apply them by directly adjusting the rcParams. For additional fine
# adjustment try to use relative font sizes. The suggested font-sizes for
# figures are generally between 7 and 9. We also use the constrainted layout for
# a better figure layout.

plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (3.5, 3.5*(3/4))
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 144
plt.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 8

fig, ax = plt.subplots() # Figure uses rcParams as  defaults
cds.plot.trans(*wls, ax=ax)

# %%
# Font selection
# --------------
# **Select a font identical or similar to the font of the publication. When in
# doubt, choose Arial or Helvetica.** The default font of matplotlib is DejaVu
# Sans. Its advantage it is free license and its great coverage of Unicode
# glyphs. But it looks quite unique and hence conflicts with the rest of
# document. Therefore I strongly advocate to change the font. Most journals have
# their own preference. If the journal does not propose a font, I suggest to use
# *Arial, Helvetica* or *TeX Gyre Heros*. While this may look boring, it
# also looks professional. 

plt.rcParams['font.family'] = ["Arial", "Helvetica", "TeX Gyre Heros"]
fig, ax = plt.subplots() # Figure uses rcParams as  defaults
cds.plot.trans(*wls, ax=ax)

# %%
# If the figure contains mathematical expressions, chaning the mathext font is
# also required for an uniform look. 

plt.rcParams['mathtext.fontset'] = "stixsans"
plt.rcParams['mathtext.default'] = 'regular'
fig, ax = plt.subplots() # Figure uses rcParams as  defaults
cds.plot.trans(*wls, ax=ax)

ax.text(0, -50, r"$A = \sum_{i=1}^n sin\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_i}\right)$")

# Figure composition
# ------------------
#
# **Try to create composite figures by code.**
#
# Most figures in journals are multi-panel figures. There are a two ways to
# create such figures: either we create the single figures first and do the
# composition of the figures with a vector graphics program like *Inkscape* or
# we create the the multi-panal graphic directly in matplotlib. So which one
# should be used?
#
# Using a vector graphics program has several advantages: wysiwyg, easy
# fine-tuning and mouse support. But this bought with some serve drawbacks: if
# you need change on of the sub-figures, you need to adjust the rest of the
# figure as well. Also, if you have to change fonts due to a resubmission, you
# have to apply it to both, the single figures and later added graphical
# elements. Also, version control not commonly supported for graphics format and
# exactly recreating a figure requires a lot manual steps.
#
# Hence, if possible, do the whole figure in matplotlib. Initially, this can
# result if a lot manual adjustment for things like text labels. This can be
# often circumvented by using the text alignment settings and changing the
# transformation.
#
# So how to built a more complex layout ? Matplotlib offers multiple ways to
# layout figures. The most flexible way is use a `gridspec
# <https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/tutorials/intermediate/gridspec.html>`__. For
# simple cases, the ``plt.sublots`` function. It supports the sharing of an axis
# and also takes Avoid the ``plt.subplot`` function.
#
# Colors
# ------
#
# **Make your colors distinguishable.**
#
# The choice of colors is matter of preferences, hence different people like
# different color-cycles. In general, the default matplotlib color-cycle works
# quite well. Still many people prefer other colors, e.g. the matlab color
# cycle, or you want to go for a more unique look. As long as you choose easily
# distinguishable colors, your are fine. Remember that figures are quite often
# used in presentations, hence to avoid remaking figures don't use bright colors
# on a white background. In general, the color should be chosen with contrast in
# mind.
#
# The color cycle is set via the axes cycler. See the `matplotlib documentation
# <https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/tutorials/intermediate/color_cycle.html>`__.
# Note that matploblib also supports xkcd ans CSS `color names
# <https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/tutorials/colors/colors.html>`__.
#
# File Format
# -----------
#
# **Use vector formats. Rasterize large artists.**
#
# Luckily, most publishers accept or require the figures in a vector format.
# Therefore save the figure as an svg oder pdf file. If you somehow must supply
# a pixel format, use png and make sure the dpi is set to at least 300.
#
# In general, using a vector format also reduces the file size. If the plot
# contains complex colormaps or images, it is appropriate to rasterize the
# corresponding artists. That means that these are embedded as an pixel graphic
# within the vector figure, thus decreasing the file size and the rendering time
# enormously.
