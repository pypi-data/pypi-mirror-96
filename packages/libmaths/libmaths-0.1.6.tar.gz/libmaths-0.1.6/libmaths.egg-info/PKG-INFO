        libmaths was created not only as a learning experience for me,
        but as a way to make mathematical models in seconds for Python users
        using math in their code. With pre-programmed mathematical functions ranging
        from linear to sextic and more, graphing in your code will be a breeze.
        
        ## Quick Demo

        </p>
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package is available on PyPI. Install with:
        
        ``` shell
        pip install libmaths
        ```
        or
        ```shell
        pip3 install libmaths
        ```
        
        libmaths only supports Python 3.8 and above, so please make sure you are on the
        newest version.
        
        ## General Usage
        
        There are many functions, but here is one example:
        
        ```python
        from libmaths import polynomial
        ```
        
        After that, graphing a quadratic function is as simple as:
        
        ``` python
        polynomial.quadratic(2, 4, 6)
        ```
        
        If you need more assistance, examples are provided

        ## General Information
        
        libmaths was created by me, a 14-year old high schooler at Lynbrook High School 3 days ago on 2/20/2021. libmaths exists to help reduce the incapability to make quick and accurate models in Python within seconds. With a limited usage of external libraries and access to a multitude of functions, libmaths' variety is one of the many things that makes it unique. With the creation of this library, I hope to bring simplicity and accuracy together.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        I am currently working on getting the documentation out to a website. It will be added upon completion.

        ## Future Plans
        
        In the future, I plan on adding several different complex functions.
        
        ## Contributing
        
        First, install the required libraries:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        Please remember that I am a high school student with less than half a year of experience in Python programming. I already know you can do better than me! If you have any issues, suggestions, or requests, please feel free to contact me by opening an issue or on my linkedin which can be found in my profile page.
        
        Thanks for contributing!
        
        ## Resources
        
        Over the three days spent in creating this library, I used plenty of resources which can be found in my code. You will see links under many of my functions which you can read about the concepts in.
