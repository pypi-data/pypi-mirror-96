        **A python toolkit for the analyis of lipid membrane simultions**

        Overview
        ========
        
        **lipyphilic** is a set of tools for analysing MD simulations of lipid bilayers. It is an object-oriented
        Python package built directly on top of `MDAnalysis <https://www.mdanalysis.org/>`__, and makes use of
        `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`__, `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`__ and `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ for
        efficient computation. The analysis classes are designed with the same interface as those of MDAnalysis -
        so if you know how to `use analysis modules in
        MDAnalysis <https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/examples/quickstart.html#Analysis>`__ then you know how
        to use **lipyphilic**!
         
        Analysis tools in **lipyphilic** include: identifying sterol flip-flop events, calculating domain registration over time,
        and calculating local lipid compositions. These tools position **lipyphilic** as complementary to, rather than
        competing against, existing membrane analysis software such as `MemSurfer <https://github.com/LLNL/MemSurfer>`__ and
        `FatSlim <http://fatslim.github.io/>`__.
        
        Check out the `Basic Usage <https://lipyphilic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`__ example to see how to use
        **lipyphilic**, and see the `Analysis tools <https://lipyphilic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/analyses.html>`__ 
        section for detailed information and exmaples on each tool.
        
        Citing
        ======
        
        If you use **lipyphilic** in your project, please cite `MDAnalysis <https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/citations/>`__ and
        if you use the Area Per Lipid tool please also cite `Freud <https://freud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/citing.html>`__.
        
        There is currently no paper describing **lipyphilic**, but we're working on it. In the meantime, if you like what we
        do, please tell everyone you know to check out **lipyphilic**! And if there are things you think we could improve, features
        you would like to see added, or pesky bugs you that need to be fixed, please raisie an issue on
        `github <https://github.com/p-j-smith/lipyphilic/issues>`__.

        ==================
        
        Head to `lipyphilic.readthedocs.io <https://lipyphilic.readthedocs.io>`__, where you will find the full documentation of
        **lipyphilic**'s API as well as examples of how to use the analysis tools.
        
        Acknowlegment
        =============
        
        The respository structure of **lipyphilic** is based on the
        `PyLibrary Cookeicutter template <https://github.com/ionelmc/cookiecutter-pylibrary>`__.
