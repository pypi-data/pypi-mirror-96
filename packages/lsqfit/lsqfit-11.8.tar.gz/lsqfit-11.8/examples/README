These .py files are simple examples showing how to use lsqfit. Use 'make
run' to run all of them, comparing the output with the corresponding .out
files.

Most of these examples are discussed in the documentation (see
doc/html/index.html):

	simple.py - "Introduction"
	y-vs-x.py - "Basic Fits"
	x-err.py - "x has Error Bars"
	p-corr.py - "Correlated Parameters; Gaussian Bayes Factor"
    y-noerr.py - "y has No Error; Marginalization"
	empbayes.py - "Tuning Priors and the Empirical Bayes Criterion"
    bayes.py - "Bayesian Integrals"
    pendulum.py - "Case Study: Pendulum"

nist.py contains 27 examples suggested by NIST as test cases for fitters.

To run under a different version of python, say python3 for example, use
'make PYTHON=python3 run'.
