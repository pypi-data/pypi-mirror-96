Description: lsqfit
        ------
        
        This package facilitates least-squares fitting of noisy data by
        multi-dimensional, nonlinear functions of arbitrarily many parameters.
        ``lsqfit`` supports Bayesian priors for the fit parameters, with arbitrarily
        complicated multidimensional Gaussian distributions. A tutorial on fitting is
        included in the documentation; documentation is in the ``doc/``
        subdirectory: see ``doc/html/index.html`` or <https://lsqfit.readthedocs.io>.
        
        The fitter uses automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the fit
        function. This greatly simplifies coding of the fit function since only the
        function itself need be coded. Coding is also simplified by using dictionaries
        (instead of arrays) for representing fit data and fit priors.
        
        ``lsqfit`` makes heavy use of Python package ``gvar``, which
        simplifies the analysis of error propagation and the creation of
        multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions (for fit priors).
        
        This code has been used on a laptop to fit functions of tens-to-thousands of
        parameters to tens-to-thousands of pieces of data.  ``lsqfit`` uses the GNU
        Scientific Library (GSL) and/or ``scipy`` to do the fitting, ``numpy`` for
        efficient array arithmetic, and ``cython`` to compile efficient code that
        interfaces between Python and the C-based GSL.
        
        Information on how to install the components is in the ``INSTALLATION`` file.
        
        To test the libraries try ``make tests``. Some examples are give in the
        ``examples/`` subdirectory.
        
        Version numbers: Incompatible changes are signaled by incrementing
        the ``major`` version number, where version numbers have the form
        ``major.minor.patch``. The ``minor`` number signals new features, and the
        ``patch`` number bug fixes.
