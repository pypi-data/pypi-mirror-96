    "A neural network in ANNarchy is a collection of interconnected **Populations**. Each population comprises a set of similar artificial **Neurons**, whose mean-firing rate or spiking behavior is governed by one or many ordinary differential equations (ODE). These ODEs are dependent on the activity of other neurons through **Synapses**. The connection pattern between two populations is called a **Projection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of the connections received by a neuron is stored in a connectivity matrix, depending on the type that was assigned to them: excitatory, inhibitory, modulatory... This typed organization of afferent connections also allows to easily apply them different learning rules (Hebbian, three-factor, Oja, BCM, STDP...).\n",

    "\n",
    "* The number of populations, their geometry (number of neurons, optionally the spatial structure - 1D/2D/3D).\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each population, the type of neuron composing it, with all the necessary ODEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each projection between two populations, the connection pattern (all-to-all, one-to-one, distance-dependent...), the initial synaptic weights, and optionally the delays in synaptic transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For plastic synapses, the ODEs describing the evolution of synaptic weights during the simulation (learning).\n",

    "* The interaction of the network with its environment (I/O relationships, rewarded tasks, fitting procedure...)\n",

    "ANNarchy provides a convenient way to define this information in a single Python script. In this manual, we will focus on an simple rate-coded network composed of two interconnected populations `pop1` and `pop2`, but more complex architectures are of course possible (see the examples in section [Examples](../Example.rst))."
