Translate Toolkit 1.4.1
=======================

*Released on 6 November 2009*

.. _changelog#csv_column_header_names:

CSV column header names
-----------------------

The names given to CSV column headers have been changed. Early releases of
:doc:`/commands/csv2po` would name the columns "comment,original,translation".
This was done mostly to make it easy for non-technical translators.  However,
comments in the command line help used terms like source and target.  This
release changes the column header names to "location,source,target", this
aligns with terms used throughout the toolkit.

If you have CSV file generated by older versions of the toolkit then a header
entry of "comment,original,translation" will be turned into a unit instead of
being ignored.  You can either change your CSV file to use the headers
"location,source,target" or delete the header row completely.  Once this is
done the files will work as expected.
