Java and Mozilla .properties
----------------------------
Unusual keys, separators and spacing should all be handled correctly now. Some
Mozilla .properties files might now have changed. Regenerate your Mozilla l10n
files from fresh POT files without any changes to your PO files to ensure that
you can see and review these changes.

Hashing in podebug
------------------
The :opt:`--hash` option in :doc:`/commands/podebug` has been replaced by a
format specifier %h to be able to better control the positioning of the hash
value.
