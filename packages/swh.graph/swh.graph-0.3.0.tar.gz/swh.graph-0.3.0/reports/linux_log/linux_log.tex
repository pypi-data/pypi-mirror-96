\maketitle

Experiment to test edge access time on the compressed graph. The goal was to do
the equivalent of a \mintinline{text}{git log} operation with a Linux commit on
the \mintinline{text}{rev_to_rev} compressed dataset.

\section{Environment}

See \mintinline{text}{LinuxLog.java}.

\section{Results}

Experiments were done on a VM with 1TB of RAM and 40vCPU.
