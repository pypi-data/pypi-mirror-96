# Welcome to exogas by Dr. Sebastian Marino

Exogas is a python package to simulate the evolution of gas in a debris disc including:

- viscous evolution
- CO photodissociation
- self-shielding
- carbon shielding
- (optional and under testing) carbon capture and CO reformation

See jupyter notebook example in examples/Example.ipynb to know how to use it. Docs coming soon...

If you use it for a project please cite Marino et al. 2020, MNRAS, Volume 492, Issue 3, p.4409-4429 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.4409M/abstract) and Marino et al. in prep.
