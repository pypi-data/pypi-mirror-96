# Overview of OpenPNM

*OpenPNM* is a comprehensive framework for performing pore network simulations of porous materials.

For more details about the package can be found in the [on-line documentation](https://pmeal.github.io/OpenPNM)

To be notified of new releases click the `Watch` button on the Github repo page.  To show your support for this project click the `Star` button, as we use this as a proxy for the size of our userbase when applying for funding.

## Installation and Requirements

### Preferred method
The preferred way of installing OpenPNM is through [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openpnm) using:

```
conda install -c conda-forge openpnm
```

### Alternative method
OpenPNM can also be installed from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/openpnm/) using:

```
pip install openpnm
```

However, we don't recommend installing using `pip` since `pypardiso`, which is a blazing fast direct solver, is not available for Windows users who use Python 3.7+.

### For developers
For developers who intend to change the source code or contribute to OpenPNM, the source code can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/pmeal/OpenPNM/) and installed by running:

```
pip install -e 'path/to/downloaded/files'
```

The advantage to installing from the source code is that you can edit the files and have access to your changes each time you import *OpenPNM*.

OpenPNM requires the *Scipy Stack* (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, etc), which is most conveniently obtained by installing the [Anaconda Distribution](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html).

## Example Usage

The following code block illustrates how to use OpenPNM to perform a mercury intrusion porosimetry simulation:

``` python

import openpnm as op
pn = op.network.Cubic(shape=[10, 10, 10], spacing=0.0001)
geo = op.geometry.StickAndBall(network=pn, pores=pn.Ps, throats=pn.Ts)
Hg = op.phases.Mercury(network=pn)
phys = op.physics.Standard(network=pn, phase=Hg, geometry=geo)
mip = op.algorithms.Porosimetry(network=pn)
mip.setup(phase=Hg)
mip.set_inlets(pores=pn.pores(['left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom']))
mip.run()

```

The network can be visualized in [`ParaView`](http://www.paraview.org) giving the following:

</p>

The drainage curve can be visualized with `mip.plot_intrusion_curve()` giving something like this:

## Asking Questions and Getting Help

Github now has a [Discussions](https://github.com/PMEAL/OpenPNM/discussions) function, which works similarly to [stack overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).  Please post your question in the [Q&A category](https://github.com/PMEAL/OpenPNM/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A) so devs or users can provide answers, vote on accepted answers, improve on each other's answers, and generally discuss things. Most importantly, all answers are searchable so eventually, once enough questions have been posted and answered, you can find what you're looking for with a simple search.

## Contact

OpenPNM is developed by the Porous Materials Engineering and Analysis Lab [(PMEAL)](http://pmeal.com), in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/chemical-engineering/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

The lead developer for this project is Prof. Jeff Gostick (jgostick@gmail.com).
