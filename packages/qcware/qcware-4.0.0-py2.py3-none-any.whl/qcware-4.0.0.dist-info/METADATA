Installation
____________

This documentation is for the latest (prerelease) version of QCWare's Forge client, which
at present relies on some internal packages.  It is "baked into" QCWare's Jupyterhub
notebooks, but local installation will have to wait until Quasar, our circuit-model
library, is publicly available.

Ordinarily, you would install as follows:

To install with pip:

.. code:: shell

   pip install qcware

Or, to install from source:

.. code:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/qcware/platform_client_library_python.git
   cd platform_client_library_python
   pip install -e .

Sign up for an API key at `https://forge.qcware.com <https://forge.qcware.com>`_ to access *Forge*. Please see our `documentation <https://qcware.readthedocs.io>`_.
