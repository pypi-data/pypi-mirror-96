    Args:
        pitches: The stream or Sequence containing pitch information. Sequence can consist of
          pitch classes (0-11), midi note numbers (12+), note names (str), music21 Pitch objects
          or music21 Note objects.
        durations: The stream or Sequence containing duration information. Sequence can consist
          of numeric values (1 = quarter note), music21 Duration objects or music21 Note objects.
        length: Optional; The length of the resulting stream, expressed in isorhythmic elements.
          By default, the process continues until the cycle is completed. For example, provided a
          color of 5 pitches and a talea of 7 rhythms, this function will, by default, return an
          isorhythm of 35 elements.

    Returns:
        The stream created by the isorhythmic process.
