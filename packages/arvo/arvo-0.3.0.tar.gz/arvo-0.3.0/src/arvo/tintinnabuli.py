    Args:
        m_voice: The stream containing the melody to use as the basis for the tintinnabuli.
        t_chord: A list of pitch-classes to use as the basis of the t-voice. Accepts letter names or
          numeric pitch classes. Can also be a music21 Chord object.
        position: Optional; The position of the t-voice. Default is 1.
        direction: Optional; The direction of the tintinnabuli process. Default is Direction.UP.
        t_mode: Optional; Determines the way the "next" note is calculated within the t-voice pitch
          classes for notes with the same note name. For example if the m-voice contains an Eb and
          the t-chord is C major: TMode.DIATONIC will consider that Eb and E are the same note, and
          will return G as the first "diatonic" t-note above. TMode.CHROMATIC ignores this and
          simply returns E as the first "chromatic" t-note above. Default is TMode.DIATONIC.

    Returns:
        A stream that contains the new t-voice.
