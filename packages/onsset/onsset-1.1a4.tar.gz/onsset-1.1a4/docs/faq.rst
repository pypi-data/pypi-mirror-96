FAQ
===

**[Q] What prior knowledge is required for someone to use OnSSET?**

[A] One should be familiar with the basic principles of energy planning and energy economics.
Experience in working with Geographic Information Systems is also essential in order to build,
analyse and visualize spatial datasets.
Python skills are necessary if one would like to modify the code.

**[Q] What type of renewable sources are used in an OnSSET model? Is it possible to add other sources (biomass etc.)?**

[A] Currently, solar photovoltaics, wind turbines and mini and small hydropower plants are considered
as off grid renewable energy technologies.
The inclusion of bioenergy and hybrid technologies constitutes an ongoing addition.

**[Q] How long does it take to complete an OnSSET electrification analysis for one country?**

[A] This depends on the size of the country, on the resolution of the analysis,
on the country specific characteristics of the grid infrastructure and on the electricity
consumption level scenarios.
Indicatively, to run Nigeria (area: 923,768 kmÂ²), at 1 km resolution and the highest electricity
consumption it takes ca. 4.5 hours (assuming that the necessary GIS layers are developed beforehand).
