Online interfaces & Applications
====================================

For those who would like to just take a taste of an OnSSET electrification analysis, KTH dESA has collaborated international organizations in order to develop interactive platforms that allow a quick display of "pre-cooked" electrification results for a number of countries. 

United Nations app
*******************

The `online interface Universal Electrification Access <https://un-modelling.github.io/electrification-paths-presentation/>`_ is part of the modelling tools for sustainable development and is based on OnSSET. This interface is not a model but it provides the user easy access to the methodology behind OnSSET, the datasets used and key results -with regards to electrification planning - obtained for a set of 30 scenarios and model runs for 54 developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

A `Web-based application <http://electrification.energydata.info/presentation/>`_ developed by the World Bank, Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, shows the dynamic of an OnSSET based electrification analysis. The tool considers a variety of open, geospatial data to determine the least-cost options for bringing electricity to areas as granular as 1 square km in size. So far three countries are included – Tanzania, Zambia, and Nigeria – and will be adapted for more.

OnSSET Online Tool
*******************

For those who would like to take a deeper dive into OnSSET modelling, KTH dESA has developed an `Online Interface <http://www.onsset.org/online-tool.html/>`_ that allows the user identify electrification pathways for a selected country and develop few alternative scenarios. The interface guides the user through a step by step process by providing a brief explanation of input data and model's functions.
