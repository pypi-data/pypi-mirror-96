Midgard, the Python Geodesy library

Midgard is a collection of useful Python utilities used by the Geodetic
institute at the Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket). Although some of
these are geodesy-specific, many are also useful in more general settings.

Note: Midgard is still in pre-alpha status. Its functionality will change,
      and it should not be depended on in any production-like setting.

Midgard comes organized into different subpackages:

+ collections
+ config
+ data
+ dev
+ files
+ gnss
+ ionosphere
+ math
+ parsers
+ plot
+ site_info
+ writers

Look for help inside each subpackage:

    >>> from midgard import subpackage  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> help(subpackage)  # doctest: +SKIP
