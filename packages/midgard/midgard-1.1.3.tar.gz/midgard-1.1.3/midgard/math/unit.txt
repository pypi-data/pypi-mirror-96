# Extra units used in Midgard, not already defined
#
# Midgard is using Pint for handling units, http://pint.readthedocs.io/. The list of units already defined in Pint is
# quite comprehensive. See https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/pint/default_en.txt or simply do
#
#     >>> from midgard.math.unit import Unit
#     >>> print(Unit.list())
#
# However, the list can also be extended. Any units defined in this file will also be available to Midgard. See
# http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/defining.html for a description of how to define new units.

unit = [] = unitless = dimensionless
percent = unit / 100
ppb = 1e-9 * unit = parts per billion
mas = milliarcsec
masD = milliarcsec per day
