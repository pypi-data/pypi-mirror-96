It\nallows users to programmatically retrieve schedules for waste removal in their area,\nincluding trash, recycling, compost, and more.\n\nSpecial thanks to @stealthhacker for the inspiration!\n\n# Installation\n\n```python\npip install aiorecollect\n```\n\n# Python Versions\n\n`aiorecollect` is currently supported on:\n\n* Python 3.7\n* Python 3.8\n* Python 3.9\n\n# Place and Service IDs\n\nTo use `aiorecollect`, you must know both your ReCollect Place and Service IDs.\n\nIn general, cities/municipalities that utilize ReCollect will give you a way to\nsubscribe to a calendar with pickup dates. If you examine the iCal URL for this\ncalendar, the Place and Service IDs are embedded in it:\n\n```\nwebcal://recollect.a.ssl.fastly.net/api/places/PLACE_ID/services/SERVICE_ID/events.en-US.ics\n```\n\n# Usage\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom datetime import date\n\nfrom aiorecollect import Client\n\n\nasync def main() -> None:\n    """Run."""\n    client = await Client("<PLACE ID>", "<SERVICE ID>")\n\n    # The client has a few attributes that you can access:\n    client.place_id\n    client.service_id\n\n    # Get all pickup events on the calendar:\n    pickup_results = await client.async_get_pickup_events()\n\n    # ...or get all pickup events within a certain date range:\n    pickup_results = await client.async_get_pickup_events(\n        start_date=date(2020, 10, 1), end_date=date(2020, 10, 31)\n    )\n\n    # ...or just get the next pickup event:\n    next_pickup = await client.async_get_next_pickup_event()\n\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n## The `PickupEvent` Object\n\nThe `PickupEvent` object that is returned from the above calls comes with three\nproperties:\n\n* `date`: a `datetime.date` that denotes the pickup date\n* `pickup_types`: a list of `PickupType` objects that will occur with this event\n* `area_name`: the name of the area in which the event is occurring\n\n## The `PickupType` Object\n\nThe `PickupType` object contains the "internal" name of the pickup type _and_ a\nhuman-friendly representation when it exists:\n\n* `name`: the internal name of the pickup type\n* `friendly_name`: the humany-friendly name of the pickup type (if it exists)\n\n## Connection Pooling\n\nBy default, the library creates a new connection to ReCollect with each coroutine. If\nyou are calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze out every second\nof runtime savings possible), an\n[`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) `ClientSession` can be used for connection\npooling:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom aiohttp import ClientSession\n\nfrom aiorecollect import Client\n\n\nasync def main() -> None:\n    """Run."""\n    async with ClientSession() as session:\n        client = await Client("<PLACE ID>", "<SERVICE ID>", session=session)\n\n        # Get to work...\n\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\n1.
