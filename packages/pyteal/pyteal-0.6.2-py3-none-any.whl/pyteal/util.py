    # The point of this conversion is to escape all special characters and turn all Unicode

    # The first step breaks up large Unicode characters into multiple UTF-8 hex characters:
    #     s_1 = s.encode("utf-8").decode("latin-1"), e.g. "\n ðŸ˜€" => "\n Ã°\x9f\x98\x80"

    #     s_1.encode("unicode-escape").decode("latin-1"), e.g. "\n Ã°\x9f\x98\x80" => "\\n \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x80"

    # If we skipped the first step we would end up with Unicode codepoints instead of hex escaped
    # characters, which TEAL assembly cannot process:
