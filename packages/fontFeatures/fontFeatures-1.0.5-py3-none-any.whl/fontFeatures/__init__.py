"""
The FontFeatures class is a way of representing the transformations -
substitutions and positionings - going on inside a font at a semantically
high level. It aims to be independent of and unconstrained by the OpenType
representation, with the assumption that these high-level objects can be
either "compiled down" into AFDKO feature code or directly written to the
GSUB/GPOS tables of a font.

FontFeatures aims to marshal data between OTF binary representations,
AFDKO feature code, FontDame, and a new language called the FEE (Font
Engineering with Extensibility) language.

A FontFeatures representation of a font will make use of two other top-level
concepts: Features and Routines. Routines are collections of rules; they play
a similar function to the AFDKO concept of a lookup, but unlike lookups,
Routines do not need to be comprised of rules of the same type. You can think
of them as functions that are called on a glyph string.
