## Introduction
* PerMetrics is a python library for performance metrics of machine learning models.

* The goals of this framework are:
    * Combine all metrics for regression, classification and clustering models
    * Helping users in all field access to metrics as fast as possible
    * Perform Qualitative Analysis of models.
    * Perform Quantitative Analysis of models.

* Metrics

### Dependencies
* Python (>= 3.6)
* Numpy (>= 1.15.1)


### User installation
Install the [current PyPI release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/permetrics):

```bash
pip install permetrics
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/thieu1995/permetrics
```


### Example
+ All you need to do is: (Make sure your y_true and y_pred is a numpy array)

```code 
* Simple example:

  ## For example with RMSE:
  
  from numpy import array
  from permetrics.regression import Metrics
  
  ## 1-D array
  y_true = array([3, -0.5, 2, 7])
  y_pred = array([2.5, 0.0, 2, 8])
  
  y_true2 = array([3, -0.5, 2, 7])
  y_pred2 = array([2.5, 0.0, 2, 9])
  
  ### C1. Using OOP style - very powerful when calculating multiple metrics
  obj1 = Metrics(y_true, y_pred)  # Pass the data here
  result = obj1.root_mean_squared_error(clean=True, decimal=5)
  print(f"1-D array, OOP style: {result}")
  
  ### C2. Using functional style
  obj2 = Metrics()
  result = obj2.root_mean_squared_error(clean=True, decimal=5, y_true=y_true2, y_pred=y_pred2)  
  # Pass the data here, remember the keywords (y_true, y_pred)
  print(f"1-D array, Functional style: {result}")
  
  ## > 1-D array - Multi-dimensional Array
  y_true = array([[0.5, 1], [-1, 1], [7, -6]])
  y_pred = array([[0, 2], [-1, 2], [8, -5]])
  
  multi_outputs = [None, "raw_values", [0.3, 1.2], array([0.5, 0.2]), (0.1, 0.9)]
  obj3 = Metrics(y_true, y_pred)
  for multi_output in multi_outputs:
      result = obj3.root_mean_squared_error(clean=False, multi_output=multi_output, decimal=5)
      print(f"n-D array, OOP style: {result}")

* Or run the simple:
    python examples/RMSE.py

* The more complicated tests in the folder: examples
```
The [documentation](https://permetrics.readthedocs.io/) includes more detailed installation instructions and explanations.

### Changelog
