#    Function: Sampling via k-fold cross-validation   #
#-----------------------------------------------------#
""" Simple wrapper function for calling k-fold cross-validation sampling functions.
    Allow usage of stratified and iterative sampling algorithm.

    Be aware that multi-label data does not support random stratified sampling.

    Returns:
        List with length n_splits containing tuples with sampled data:
        For example: (train_x, train_y, test_x, test_y)

    Arguments:
        samples (List of Strings):      List of sample/index encoded as Strings.
        labels (NumPy matrix):          NumPy matrix containing the ohe encoded classification.
        n_splits (Integer):             Number of folds (k). Must be at least 2.
        stratified (Boolean):           Option whether to use stratified sampling based on provided labels.
        iterative (Boolean):            Option whether to use iterative sampling algorithm.
        seed (Integer):                 Seed to ensure reproducibility for random functions.
