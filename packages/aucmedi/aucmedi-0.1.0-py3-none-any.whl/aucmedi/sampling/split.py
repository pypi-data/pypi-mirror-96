#       Function: Sampling via Percentage Split       #
#-----------------------------------------------------#
""" Simple wrapper function for calling percentage split sampling functions.
    Allow usage of stratified and iterative sampling algorithm.

    Be aware that multi-label data does not support random stratified sampling.

    Percentage split ratios have to be provided with a sampling list.
    Each percentage value in the list defines the approximate split size.
    Sum of percentage split ratios have to equal 1!

    For example: sampling = [0.7, 0.25, 0.05]
    Returns a list with the following elements as tuples:
        -> (samples_a, labels_a) with 70% of complete dataset
        -> (samples_b, labels_b) with 25% of complete dataset
        -> (samples_c, labels_c) with  5% of complete dataset

    Arguments:
        samples (List of Strings):      List of sample/index encoded as Strings.
        labels (NumPy matrix):          NumPy matrix containing the ohe encoded classification.
        sampling (List of Floats):      List of percentage values with split sizes.
        stratified (Boolean):           Option whether to use stratified sampling based on provided labels.
        iterative (Boolean):            Option whether to use iterative sampling algorithm.
        seed (Integer):                 Seed to ensure reproducibility for random functions.
