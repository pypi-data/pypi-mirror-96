""" Inference Augmenting function for automatically augmenting unknown images for prediction.
    The predictions of the augmented images are then aggregated together via the provided
    aggregate function.

    The aggregate function can be either self initialized with an AUCMEDI aggregate function
    or a custom made aggregate function, or by calling an AUCMEDI aggregate function by name.
    Possible aggregate function names: ["mean", "median", "majority_vote", "softmax"]

    The Image Augmentation class instance which will be used for inference augmenting,
    can be either predefined or leaving None.
    If the img_aug is None, a Image Augmentation class instance is automatically created
    which applies scaling, rotation and flipping augmentations.

Arguments:
    model (Neural_Network):         Instance of a AUCMEDI neural network class.
    samples (List of Strings):      List of sample/index encoded as Strings.
    path_imagedir (String):         Path to the directory containing the images.
    n_cycles (Integer):             Number of image augmentations, which should be created per sample.
    img_aug (ImageAugmentation):    Image Augmentation class instance which performs diverse data augmentation techniques.
    aggregate (String or aggregate Function):
                                    Aggregate function class instance or a string for an AUCMEDI aggregate function.
    image_format (String):          Image format to add at the end of the sample index for image loading.
    batch_size (Integer):           Number of samples inside a single batch.
    resize (Tuple of Integers):     Resizing shape consisting of a X and Y size.
    grayscale (Boolean):            Boolean, whether images are grayscale or RGB.
    subfunctions (List of Subfunctions):
                                    List of Subfunctions class instances which will be SEQUENTIALLY executed on the data set.
    standardize_mode (String):      Standardization modus in which image intensity values are scaled.
    seed (Integer):                 Seed to ensure reproducibility for random function.
    workers (Integer):              Number of workers. If n_workers > 1 = use multi-threading for image preprocessing.
