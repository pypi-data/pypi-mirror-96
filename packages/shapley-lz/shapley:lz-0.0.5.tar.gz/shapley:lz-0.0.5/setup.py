# next built this by running the command
# 'python setup.py bdist_wheel' in terminal --> outputs a wheel file, that is appropriate to upload to PiPy
# copies .py code file into the lib directory
# gitignore egg-info
# build directory --> moved files here
# actual wheel file in dist directory

# then 'pip install -e .' --> -e links to the code one is working on NOT copying code into another location.
# Hence once installed can continue working on it, w/o having two copies of code.
# Full stop says install THIS package in the current directory (defined by setup.py file)
# run this everytime changing setup.py file.

# N.B. code is now in source directory not in current directory --> cannot import code.py yet
