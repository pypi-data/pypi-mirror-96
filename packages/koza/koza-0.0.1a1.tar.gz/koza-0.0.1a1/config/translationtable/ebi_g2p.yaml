# both DD and IF - plausible disease-causing mutations within,
# affecting or encompassing the coding region of a single gene

# 1. plausible disease-causing mutations* within, affecting or encompassing an
# interpretable functional region** of a single  gene identified in
# multiple (>3) unrelated cases/families with a developmental disorder
#
# 2. plausible disease-causing mutations within, affecting or encompassing
# cis-regulatory elements convincingly affecting the expression of a single gene
# identified in multiple (>3) unrelated cases/families with a developmental disorder
#
# 3. as definition 1 and 2 of probable dd gene (see below) with addition of convincing
# bioinformatic or functional evidence of causation e.g. known inborn error of metabolism
# with mutation in orthologous gene which is known to have the relevant
# deficient enzymatic activity in other species; existence of animal mode which
# recapitulates the human phenotype

# 1. plausible disease-causing mutations within, affecting or encompassing an
