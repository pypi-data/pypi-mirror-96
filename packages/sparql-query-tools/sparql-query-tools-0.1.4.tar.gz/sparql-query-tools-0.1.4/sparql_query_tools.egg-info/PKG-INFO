Description: # SPARQL Query Tools
        
        Currently, SPARQL query tools include exactly one tool: `sparql_result_analysis`
        
        More will be integrated later so that the plural in the name will make sense. ðŸ˜‰
        
        ## Tools
        
        - `sparql_result_analysis`: Queries a triple store and provides info and metrics on the results. Creates a folder with the resulting json files, and a CSV file containing the infos and metrics about the querying and results. 
        
        ## Install
        
        From git repository:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/dice-group/sparql-query-tools.git
