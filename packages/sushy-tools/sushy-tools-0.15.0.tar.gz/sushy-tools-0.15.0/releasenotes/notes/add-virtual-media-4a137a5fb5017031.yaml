    Adds Virtual Media resource.

    As of this release, user can configure a collection of virtual
    media devices including their types, names and other properies.
    By default, ``cdrom`` and ``floppy`` devices are configured.

    Each Manager automatically gets its own instance of the above
    mentioned virtual media device collection. HTTP/S-hosted images
    can be inserted into and ejected from virtual media devices.

    If libvirt virtualization backend is being used, once ISO image
    is inserted into the respective Manager, any System under that
    Manager can boot from that image by booting from its local ``cdrom``
    over UEFI.

    The ISO images must be UEFI-bootable or hybrid.
