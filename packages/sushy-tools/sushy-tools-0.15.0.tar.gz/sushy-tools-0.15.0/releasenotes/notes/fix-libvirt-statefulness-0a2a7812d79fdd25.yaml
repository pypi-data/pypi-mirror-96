    Brings libvirt domain down prior to any change. When Redfish emulator
    is running against libvirt virtualization backend, any changes being
    done to domain are not applied for as long as the domain is up. This
    leads to two nuisances:

    + REST API is not really REST-ful meaning that successfully
      applied change is not reflected in the document tree
    + Multiple changes done to live domain XML tree may override one
      another because N-1 change done to a domain is not visible
      to N's change

    The fix is to bring running domain down briefly while the change is
    applied.
