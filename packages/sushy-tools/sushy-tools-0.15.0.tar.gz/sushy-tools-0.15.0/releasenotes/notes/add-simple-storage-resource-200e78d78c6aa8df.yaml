    Adds emulation support for Simple Storage resource to libvirt
    virtualization backend of the dynamic Redfish emulator. The emulation
    functionality assumes that the storage devices attached to a VM are
    configured as a libvirt Volume via a storage pool. Devices not configured
    as a Volume will not be considered for emulation purposes.
