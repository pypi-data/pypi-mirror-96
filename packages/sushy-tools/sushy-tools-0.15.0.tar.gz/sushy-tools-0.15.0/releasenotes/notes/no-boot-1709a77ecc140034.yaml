    Reads hardware state from libvirt domain XML

    Now reads boot device/mode/image from domain XML on
    filesystem rather then the running VM, thus avoiding
    the need for a reboot after setting soemthing. The client
    should now power cycle the instance if the changes are
    required in the running VM.
    note: not simply a soft reboot.
