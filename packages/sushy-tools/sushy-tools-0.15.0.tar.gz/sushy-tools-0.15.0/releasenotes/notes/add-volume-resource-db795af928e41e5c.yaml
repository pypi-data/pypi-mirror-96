    Adds Volume resource emulation support.

    As of this release, a user can configure a collection of Volumes including
    the VolumeType and Capacity. The configured volumes will appear as libvirt
    volumes in the libvirt virtualization backend of the dynamic Redfish
    emulator (provided the libvirt pool specified for the volume exists).

    Volume creation via POST request is also supported.

    In case the Openstack backend is used, the NotSupportedError is raised.
