    The ExtractAlpha Cross-Asset Model 1 (CAM1) is an innovative quantitative stock selection model designed to capture the information contained in options market prices and volumes. The listed equity options market is composed of investors who on average are more informed and information-driven than their cash equity counterparts, due to the higher levels of conviction that are associated with levered bets. This results in a unique model which profits from gradual cross-asset information flows.
    In historical simulations, high-scoring stocks according to CAM1 outperform low-scoring stocks by 17% per annum with a market-neutral Sharpe ratio of 3.0 before transaction costs. CAM1 is particularly effective in volatile regimes and for mid- and small-cap stocks, and is best used in conjunction with other alpha signals with similar time horizons.

    The Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) system incorporates Federal enforcement and compliance (FE&C) data from the Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS), used to track federal enforcement cases. ICIS contains information on federal administrative and federal judicial cases under the following environmental statutes: the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) Section 313, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA).
    ICIS is a case activity tracking and management system for civil, judicial, and administrative federal EPA enforcement cases. Case information is supplied and updated by EPA’s Offices of Regional Counsel and Office of Civil Enforcement case attorneys. The basic structure of an ICIS FE&C record focuses on an enforcement case. It is assigned a case number and a case name which identifies the defendant (or principal defendant if more than one is named in the complaint). For administrative actions, the record includes the nature of the violation, statute(s) involved, and milestone dates (e.g., the date the order was issued). Judicial actions contain information similar to that for administrative actions, but include more detailed milestone dates.
    Data is organized around two concepts: the enforcement case and a resulting settlement(s) (enforcement conclusion). Enforcement case data describe the enforcement action from initiation through to its conclusion. If multiple defendants, facilities, and/or violations are cited in the case, then a single case may result in multiple settlements. These case conclusions describe what has been ordered and/or agreed upon to be performed to address violations identified by the case complaint.

    """The ExtractAlpha Tactical Model 1 (TM1) is a quantitative stock selection model designed to capture the technical dynamics of single US equities over one to ten trading day horizons. TM1 is a tactical factor, in that it can assist a longer- horizon investor in timing their entry or exit points, or be used in combination with existing systematic or qualitative strategies with similar holding periods.
    In historical simulations, high-scoring stocks according to TM1 outperform low- scoring stocks by 59% per annum with a market-neutral Sharpe ratio of 4.4 before transaction costs, versus 25% and a Sharpe of 1.1 for a basic reversal factor with comparable turnover. Unlike many quantitative stock selection factors, TM1 exhibits comparable returns for large-cap stocks and small-cap stocks, and it is particularly effective in volatile regimes.
    TM1’s alpha is realized between one and ten days, and so may not be appropriate as a signal on which to trade directly for some investment managers with long horizons or large AUMs. However TM1 could be used to time trades that a longer-horizon strategy would enter regardless, thereby improving the price of the entry and exit points without incurring incremental transaction costs.
    A basic fundamental and momentum strategy with annual net returns of 5.5%, a net Sharpe Ratio of 0.55, and daily turnover of 6.4% can be improved to annual net returns of 10.0% and a net Sharpe Ratio of 0.97, with a slight reduction of turnover, by implementing simple TM1-based entry and exit rules. The value added is very consistent over time, offers drawdown protection in volatile markets, and survives reasonable transaction cost and latency assumptions.
    TM1 is therefore effective as a tactical overlay which can improve risk-adjusted returns without unduly influencing the underlying strategy. The implementation could be as straightforward as a daily pre-trade screen on position entries and exits prior to the open.
