#
# <h3>Thanks for using the AerisWeather Python SDK!</h3>
# <p>The goal of this SDK is to make it easier for Python developers to add weather content and functionality to their
# various projects. The weather data provided by the SDK comes from AerisWeather's
# <a href="https://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/api/" target=blank_>Aeris API</a>. The AerisWeather Python SDK
# is built on Python v3.6.</p>
# <p>This documentation was built using <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/" target=blank_>Doxygen</a>,
# and is the detailed technical docs for the SDK code. For more
# information regarding how to get started using the SDK, including code samples and a demo project, check out the
# project page on GitHub, and the Python SDK Toolkit pages on the AerisWeather website.</p>
# <p>To use the AerisWeather Python SDK you'll need an active AerisWeather client Id and Secret. If you're not
# already an AerisWeather member, you can sign up for a free developer account at
