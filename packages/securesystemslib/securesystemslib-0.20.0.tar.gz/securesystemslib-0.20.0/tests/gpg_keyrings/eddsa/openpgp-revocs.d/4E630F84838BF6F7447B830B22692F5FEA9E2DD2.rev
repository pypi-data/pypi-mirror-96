This is a revocation certificate for the OpenPGP key:

pub  ed25519/EA9E2DD2 2019-10-28
      Key fingerprint = 4E63 0F84 838B F6F7 447B  830B 2269 2F5F EA9E 2DD2
uid                  Test Ed25519 Key <test@ed25519.key>

A revocation certificate is a kind of "kill switch" to publicly
declare that a key shall not anymore be used.  It is not possible
to retract such a revocation certificate once it has been published.

Use it to revoke this key in case of a compromise or loss of
the secret key.  However, if the secret key is still accessible,
it is better to generate a new revocation certificate and give
a reason for the revocation.  For details see the description of
of the gpg command "--gen-revoke" in the GnuPG manual.

To avoid an accidental use of this file, a colon has been inserted
before the 5 dashes below.  Remove this colon with a text editor
before importing and publishing this revocation certificate.
