## Get started

::: tip

This section describes how to get up and running with the Python client.

See the [examples page](https://www.mailslurp.com/examples/) for more examples and use with common frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pytest.

See the method documentation for a [list of all functions](./docs)

:::

### Create API Key

First you'll need an API Key. [Create a free account](https://app.mailslurp.com) and copy the key from your dashboard.

### Install package

MailSlurp has an official PyPI package called `mailslurp-client`. It supports Python version 2 and 3.

```bash
pip install mailslurp-client
```

On some systems you may need to install `distutils`.

### Configure

Once installed you can import `mailslurp_client` and create a configuration with your [API Key](https://app.mailslurp.com).

```python
import mailslurp_client

configuration = mailslurp_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['x-api-key'] = "your-api-key-here"
```

## Common usage

MailSlurp can be used to create email addresses than can send and receive real emails and attachments in Python.

### Create an email address

Use `with` statements to create controllers for each endpoint of the MailSlurp API.

```python
def create_inbox_example():
    with mailslurp_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:

        # create an inbox using the inbox controller
        api_instance = mailslurp_client.InboxControllerApi(api_client)
        inbox = api_instance.create_inbox()

        # check the id and email_address of the inbox
        assert len(inbox.id) > 0
        assert "mailslurp.com" in inbox.email_address
```

### List inboxes

```python
def test_can_list_inboxes(self):
    # use the with keyword to create an api client
    with mailslurp_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
        # create an inbox using the inbox controller
        inbox_controller = mailslurp_client.InboxControllerApi(api_client)
        inboxes = inbox_controller.get_all_inboxes(page=0)

        # pagination properties
        assert inboxes.total_pages > 0
        assert inboxes.total_elements > 0

        # view contents
        assert len(inboxes.content[0].id) > 0
```

### Send emails

```python
def send_email_example():
    with mailslurp_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
        # first create an inbox
        api_instance = mailslurp_client.InboxControllerApi(api_client)
        inbox = api_instance.create_inbox()

        # send email from the inbox
        send_email_options = mailslurp_client.SendEmailOptions()
        send_email_options.to = [inbox.email_address]
        send_email_options.subject = "Hello"
        send_email_options.body = "Your message"
        send_email_options.is_html = True
        api_instance.send_email(inbox.id, send_email_options=send_email_options)
```

### Use attachments
To send attachments first use the `AttachmentControllerApi` to upload a file or byte stream. Then use the attachment ID returned with subsequent send calls.

```python
@staticmethod
def upload_attachment():
    with mailslurp_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
        import base64

        file_bytes = "Your file's bytes".encode("utf-8")
        encoded_contents = base64.b64encode(file_bytes)
        attachment_controller = mailslurp_client.AttachmentControllerApi(api_client)

        upload_options = mailslurp_client.UploadAttachmentOptions(
            content_type="text/plain",
            filename="test.txt",
            base64_contents=str(encoded_contents, 'utf-8')
        )
        print("upload_options = {}".format(upload_options))
        return attachment_controller.upload_attachment(upload_options)
```

### Receive emails and extract content

```python
def receive_email_and_extract_content_example():
    with mailslurp_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
        # create two inboxes for testing
        inbox_controller = mailslurp_client.InboxControllerApi(api_client)
        inbox_1 = inbox_controller.create_inbox()
        inbox_2 = inbox_controller.create_inbox()

        # send email from inbox 1 to inbox 2
        send_email_options = mailslurp_client.SendEmailOptions()
        send_email_options.to = [inbox_2.email_address]
        send_email_options.subject = "Hello inbox 2"
        send_email_options.body = "Your code is: 123"
        send_email_options.attachments = self.upload_attachment() # see previous section

        inbox_controller.send_email(inbox_1.id, send_email_options=send_email_options)

        # receive email for inbox 2
        waitfor_controller = mailslurp_client.WaitForControllerApi(api_client)
        email = waitfor_controller.wait_for_latest_email(inbox_id=inbox_2.id, timeout=30000, unread_only=True)

        assert email.subject == "Hello inbox 2"

        # extract content from body
        import re
        pattern = re.compile('Your code is: ([0-9]{3})')
        matches = pattern.match(email.body)
        code = matches.group(1)

        assert code == "123"
```

### Download attachments
```python

def receive_email_and_extract_content_example():
    with mailslurp_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
        # wait for email to be received by inbox 2
        email = wait_controller.wait_for_latest_email(inbox_id=inbox_2.id, timeout=30000, unread_only=True)

        # assert that the message was received
        assert email.inbox_id == inbox_2.id
        assert email.subject == "Hello"
        
        # attachment ids pressent
        assert len(email.attachments) == 1

        # download attachment content
        email_controller = mailslurp_client.EmailControllerApi(api_client)
        downloaded_bytes = email_controller.download_attachment(email.attachments[0], email.id)
        assert len(downloaded_bytes) > 0

        # alternatively download as base64 string with more meta data
        email_controller = mailslurp_client.EmailControllerApi(api_client)
        downloaded_attachment = email_controller.download_attachment_base64(email.attachments[0], email.id)
        assert downloaded_attachment.content_type == "text/plain"
        base64_contents = downloaded_attachment.base64_file_contents
        import base64
        attachment_bytes = base64.b64decode(base64_contents)
        assert len(attachment_bytes) > 0
```

### Verify email address
You can verify email addresses with MailSlurp. This will perform SMTP queries for the email address on your behalf.

```python
def test_validate_email(self):
    with mailslurp_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
        mailserver_controller = mailslurp_client.MailServerControllerApi(api_client)
        verify_options = mailslurp_client.VerifyEmailAddressOptions(email_address="test@gmail.com")
        result = mailserver_controller.verify_email_address(verify_options=verify_options)
        assert result.error is None
        assert result.is_valid is True
```
