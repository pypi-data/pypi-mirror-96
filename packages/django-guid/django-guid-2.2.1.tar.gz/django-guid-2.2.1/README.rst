Django GUID attaches a unique correlation ID to all your log outputs for every requests you handle. In other words, every error, and really every log now has an ID connecting it to all other relevant logs, making
debugging simple.

The package stores a GUID to an object, making it accessible by using the ID of the current thread. This makes integrations possible, as the ID can be returned as a header (built in setting) or forwarded manually to other systems (built in API), making it possible to extend the reach of correlation IDs to whole systems.

**Examples**

Log output with a GUID:

.. code-block::

    INFO ... [773fa6885e03493498077a273d1b7f2d] project.views This is a DRF view log, and should have a GUID.
    WARNING ... [773fa6885e03493498077a273d1b7f2d] project.services.file Some warning in a function
    INFO ... [0d1c3919e46e4cd2b2f4ac9a187a8ea1] project.views This is a DRF view log, and should have a GUID.

Log output without a GUID:

    WARNING ... project.services.file Some warning in a function

************
Installation
************

Install using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install django-guid


********
Settings
********

Package settings are added in your ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    DJANGO_GUID = {
        GUID_HEADER_NAME = 'Correlation-ID',
        VALIDATE_GUID = True,
        RETURN_HEADER = True,
        EXPOSE_HEADER = True,
        INTEGRATIONS = [],
        IGNORE_URLS = [],
    }



**Optional Parameters**

* :code:`GUID_HEADER_NAME`
        The name of the GUID to look for in a header in an incoming request. Remember that it's case insensitive.

    Default: Correlation-ID

* :code:`VALIDATE_GUID`
        Whether the :code:`GUID_HEADER_NAME` should be validated or not.
        If the GUID sent to through the header is not a valid GUID (:code:`uuid.uuid4`).

    Default: True

* :code:`RETURN_HEADER`
        Whether to return the GUID (Correlation-ID) as a header in the response or not.
        It will have the same name as the :code:`GUID_HEADER_NAME` setting.

    Default: True

* :code:`EXPOSE_HEADER`
        Whether to return :code:`Access-Control-Expose-Headers` for the GUID header if
        :code:`RETURN_HEADER` is :code:`True`, has no effect if :code:`RETURN_HEADER` is :code:`False`.
        This is allows the JavaScript Fetch API to access the header when CORS is enabled.

    Default: True

* :code:`INTEGRATIONS`
        Whether to enable any custom or available integrations with :code:`django_guid`.
        As an example, using :code:`SentryIntegration()` as an integration would set Sentry's :code:`transaction_id` to
        match the GUID used by the middleware.

    Default: []

* :code:`IGNORE_URLS`
        URL endpoints where the middleware will be disabled. You can put your health check endpoints here.

    Default: []

*************
Configuration
*************

Once settings have set up, add the following to your projects' ``settings.py``:

1. Installed Apps
=================

Add :code:`django_guid` to your :code:`INSTALLED_APPS`:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'django_guid',
    ]


2. Middleware
=============

Add the :code:`django_guid.middleware.GuidMiddleware` to your ``MIDDLEWARE``:

.. code-block:: python

    MIDDLEWARE = [
        'django_guid.middleware.GuidMiddleware',
        ...
     ]


It is recommended that you add the middleware at the top, so that the remaining middleware loggers include the requests GUID.

3. Logging Configuration
========================

Add :code:`django_guid.log_filters.CorrelationId` as a filter in your ``LOGGING`` configuration:

.. code-block:: python

    LOGGING = {
        ...
        'filters': {
            'correlation_id': {
                '()': 'django_guid.log_filters.CorrelationId'
            }
        }
    }

Put that filter in your handler:

.. code-block:: python

    LOGGING = {
        ...
        'handlers': {
            'console': {
                'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
                'formatter': 'medium',
                'filters': ['correlation_id'],
            }
        }
    }

And make sure to add the new ``correlation_id`` filter to one or all of your formatters:

.. code-block:: python

    LOGGING = {
        ...
        'formatters': {
            'medium': {
                'format': '%(levelname)s %(asctime)s [%(correlation_id)s] %(name)s %(message)s'
            }
        }
    }


If these settings were confusing, please have a look in the demo projects'
`settings.py <https://github.com/JonasKs/django-guid/blob/master/demoproj/settings.py>`_ file for a complete example.

4. Django GUID Logger (Optional)
================================

If you wish to see the Django GUID middleware outputs, you may configure a logger for the module.
Simply add django_guid to your loggers in the project, like in the example below:

.. code-block:: python

    LOGGING = {
        ...
        'loggers': {
            'django_guid': {
                'handlers': ['console', 'logstash'],
                'level': 'WARNING',
                'propagate': False,
            }
        }
    }

This is especially useful when implementing the package, if you plan to pass existing GUIDs to the middleware, as misconfigured GUIDs will not raise exceptions, but will generate warning logs.
