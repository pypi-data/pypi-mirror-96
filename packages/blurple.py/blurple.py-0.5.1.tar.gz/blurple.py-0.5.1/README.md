Blurple.py is a framework built on top of discord.py, giving you the tools you need to build discord bots with convenience.

Here's what's included:
1. `blurple.ui` All the styled components you'll ever need for building user interfaces in discord.
    - Planned support for modals and more in the future, using discord's new api.
2. `blurple.io` Robust functions that enable you to build stable, multi-step commands with ease.
    - Support for multi-event replies, and timeout handling by default.
3. `blurple.ext` Utilities and sane defaults for discord.ext commands.
    - An unopinionated drop-in replacement for the builtin help command.
    - A minimal, route-based microframework for registering commands.
