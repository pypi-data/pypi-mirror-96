Description: # dhivehi-nlp
        
        Natural language processing tools for the Dhivehi language.
        
        Contains the following modules:
        
        Tokenizer - Tokenize text into separate sentences or words (tokens).
        
        Stopwords - Remove stopwords from text and return the resulting tokens.
        
        Stemmer - Remove suffixes from words to return their root form.
        
        Language Models - Create language models to predict future additions. Language models will give
        probability based on selected ngram. An ngram is contiguous sequence of n tokens
        from the given input text.
        
        Dictionary- Get definitions definitions of Dhivehi words and the word list. Definitions
        obtained from radheef.mv. 
        
        Corpus - Collections of various Dhivehi texts.
        
        Trigram Similarity - Trigram similarity divides words or phrases into sequences of three
        consecutive letters, placed in a set where the order doesn't matter and
        duplicates are removed. Used to find string matches even if certain characters
        are different or out of order, based on similarity value.
        
        Tagger - Tag words in text according to specified rules or patterns. For example,
        tagging words based on which part of speech it belongs to.
