# PyCTR
Python library to interact with Nintendo 3DS files.

The API is not yet stable. If you decide to use this, you should stick to a specific version on pypi, or store a copy locally, until it is stable.

This was recently separated out to its own repository. This will be a better README at some point.

Support can be found on Discord ([info](https://ihaveahax.net/view/Discord), [invite link](https://discord.gg/YVuFUrs))
