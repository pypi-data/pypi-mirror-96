Description: IsoSolve is a Python module realizing an integrative framework for isotope labeling measurements. It can provide both symbolic and numeric solutions for integrating and consolidating heterogeneous measurements, e.g. NMR and MS measuring ¹³C labeling, to cite the most wide spread ones. This integrative framework helps to
        
           i) clarify and improve the coverage of the isotopic space;
           ii) evaluate the complementarity and redundancy of different techniques;
           iii) consolidate isotopic datasets;
           iv) design experiments, and
           v) guide future analytical developments.
        
        This framework can be applied to any labeled element, isotopic tracer, metabolite, and analytical platform.
        
        IsoSolve is available as a Python library with a command line interface. It is one of the routine tools that we use at the `MetaSys team <http://www.toulouse-biotechnology-institute.fr/en/research/molecular-physiology-and-metabolism/metasys.html>`_ and `MetaToul platform <http://www.toulouse-biotechnology-institute.fr/en/technology_platforms/metabolomics-fluxomics.html>`_ in isotopic studies of metabolic systems.
        
        A paper on this subject is under preparation.
        
        If you have an idea on how we could improve IsoSolve please submit a new issue to our `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/sgsokol/isosolve/issues>`_.
