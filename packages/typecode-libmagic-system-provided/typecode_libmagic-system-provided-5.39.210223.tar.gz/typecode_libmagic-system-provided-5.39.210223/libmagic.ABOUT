  Fine Free File Command
  This is the home page for the open source implementation of the file(1) 
  command that ships with most free operating systems (Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD,
  etc.) and has been ported to most systems where people use free software 
  (including OS/2, DOS, MS Windows, etc.). The lone standout, OpenBSD, wrote
  their own code, but still use our file command's configuration files.
